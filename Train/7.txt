Parkinson disease (PD) is a neurodegenerative disorder pathologically characterized by nigrostriatal dopamine neuron loss and the
postmortem presence of Lewy bodies, depositions of insoluble
α-synuclein, and other proteins that likely contribute to cellular
toxicity and death during the disease. Genetic and biochemical
studies have implicated impaired lysosomal and mitochondrial
function in the pathogenesis of PD. Transmembrane protein 175
(TMEM175), the lysosomal K+ channel, is centered under a major
genome-wide association studies peak for PD, making it a potential
candidate risk factor for the disease. To address the possibility that
variation in TMEM175 could play a role in PD pathogenesis, TMEM175
function was investigated in a neuronal model system. Studies
confirmed that TMEM175 deficiency results in unstable lysosomal
pH, which led to decreased lysosomal catalytic activity, decreased
glucocerebrosidase activity, impaired autophagosome clearance
by the lysosome, and decreased mitochondrial respiration. Moreover, TMEM175 deficiency in rat primary neurons resulted in increased susceptibility to exogenous α-synuclein fibrils. Following
α-synuclein fibril treatment, neurons deficient in TMEM175 were
found to have increased phosphorylated and detergent-insoluble
α-synuclein deposits. Taken together, data from these studies suggest that TMEM175 plays a direct and critical role in lysosomal and
mitochondrial function and PD pathogenesis and highlight this ion
channel as a potential therapeutic target for treating PD.
TMEM175 | lysosome | mitochondria | α-synuclein | Parkinson disease
Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have identified a
large number of loci that alter the risk of developing Parkinson disease (PD) (1). Given the nature of idiopathic PD as a
complex, multifaceted disease, these non-Mendelian variants typically result in small increases or decreases in disease risk. However,
the causal variants under the majority of GWAS peaks have not
been definitively identified (2, 3). Characterizing the biological
function of genes located in GWAS-implicated regions in the
context of molecular and cellular development of PD may help to
identify pathways that are critical in the etiology of the disease.
Several genes associated with PD (both Mendelian and GWAS)
function in the lysosomal degradation pathway. Lysosomal degradation serves as a key final step to resolve protein aggregation in the
process of macroautophagy and chaperone-mediated autophagy,
and mutations that impair this process have been suggested to cause
α-synuclein aggregation and downstream cellular toxicity. Mutations
in the lysosomal hydrolase glucocerebrosidase (GBA) substantially
increase the risk of PD (4, 5) and have been reported to compromise lysosomal degradation and increase α-synuclein aggregation (6). Mutations in lysosomal type 5 P-type ATPase (ATP13A2),
a lysosomal ATPase, cause early-onset Parkinsonian syndrome (7)
and have also been shown to cause lysosomal impairment.
ATP13A2 mutations are linked to impaired acidification, decreased
proteolytic processing, reduced degradation of lysosomal substrates,
diminished lysosomal-mediated clearance of autophagosome, and
neurotoxicity via the accumulation of α-synuclein (8, 9). Vacuolar protein sorting-associated protein 35 (VPS35) deficiency,
also linked to familial PD (10), has been shown to perturb the
maturation step of cathepsin D (CTSD) by increasing mannose6-phosplate receptor turnover, resulting in accumulation of
α-synuclein in the lysosomes (11). VPS35 gene deletion in dopamine neurons has also been reported to result in accumulation
of α-synuclein and dopamine neuron loss (12, 13).
Mitophagy, the selective autophagy of mitochondria, also requires lysosomal degradation (14) and has also been implicated
in the pathogenesis of PD. Phosphatase and tensin homolog
deleted on chromosome 10-induced putative kinase 1 (PINK1), a
mitochondrial ubiquitin kinase, and parkin, an E3 ubiqutin ligase,
together initiate ubiquitin-mediated autophagosome formation
around mitochondria (15–18). Mutations in genes encoding
these proteins cause early-onset parkinsonian syndrome (19, 20).
Mutations in F-box protein 7 that also cause early-onset autosomal recessive PD (21, 22) were recently shown to act on the
parkin-mediated mitophagy by directly interacting with PINK1
and parkin (23). Although there are varying degrees of α-synuclein pathology in PINK1 or parkin-associated PD cases, reduced
respiratory capacity and increased susceptibility to oxidative
stress by the impairment of mitochondria quality control was
demonstrated to lead to dopaminergic neuronal damage (24,
25). Additionally, overexpression of PINK1 or parkin can protect
cells against toxicity associated with reduced proteasome function induced by synuclein aggregation (26, 27). Although it remains to be determined whether dysregulation of mitophagy also
Significance
Genetic studies have identified potential risk factors that have
helped elucidate biological pathways involved in the development of Parkinson disease (PD). However, the majority of
genome-wide association studies-implicated loci contain multiple genes requiring further investigation to establish the
causality of any nominated gene to the pathology of associated disease. Here, we provide functional evidence that deficiency of the lysosomal K+ channel transmembrane protein
175, discovered under the third most-significant PD genomewide association study peak, is critical for pathogenesis of PD
by impairing lysosomal and mitochondrial function.

contributes to sporadic PD, maintenance of mitochondrial health is
clearly linked to the molecular pathology of PD.
Human transmembrane protein 175 (TMEM175), recently
identified from a lysosomal proteome (28), is a K+ channel located
in late endosomes and lysosomes (29). A PD GWAS meta-analysis
(1) identified a highly significant risk loci on chromosome 4, which
covers several genes, including TMEM175. Identification of the
candidate gene residing in this peak could be critical, not only to
understanding the pathogenesis of PD but also in identifying a novel
genetically validated therapeutic target for treating the disease. If in
fact TMEM175 is the candidate gene, then as a K+ channel there is
a high potential for druggability and there is a tractable therapeutic
strategy. TMEM175 appears a likely candidate, as it has been
shown to regulate lysosomal membrane potential, pH stability,
and organelle fusion via potassium conductance on lysosomal
and endosomal membranes (29). To help resolve a potential link
between TMEM175 and PD, we have characterized the effects of
TMEM175 in the context of lysosomal and mitochondrial function, as well as the susceptibility to α-synuclein aggregation in
both neuroblastoma and primary neuron cellular systems. We
show that TMEM175 deficiency impairs lysosomal degradation,
lysosome-mediated autophagosome clearance, and mitochondrial respiratory capacity. These cellular defects result in increased
neuronal susceptibility to exogenously applied α-synuclein fibrils, a
well-studied model of α-synuclein uptake, processing, and degradation. Our findings suggest that TMEM175 loss-of-function mutations likely impair autophagy-mediated degradation of α-synuclein
oligomeric species and, moreover, that variation in TMEM175
may be in part responsible for the linkage of the chromosome
4:951,947 GWAS peak to PD risk.
Results
TMEM175 Deficiency Decreased Lysosomal Catalytic Activity in
Neuronal Cells via Destabilized Lysosomal pH. TMEM175 was
identified as a K+ channel that mediates potassium conductance
on lysosomal and endosomal membranes, and thus regulates
lysosomal membrane potential and pH in RAW 246.7 murine
macrophages (29). To determine if TMEM175 serves a similar
function in cells of neuronal origin, knockout of TMEM175
(KO) was engineered in the SH-SY5Y neuroblastoma cell line
using a CRISPR/Cas9 approach (Fig. 1A). Under fed conditions,
in media containing 10% (vol/vol) serum, lysosomal pH of
TMEM175 KO SH-SY5Y was slightly more acidic than WT.
Upon starvation in Earle’s Balanced Salt Solution (EBSS) for
3 h, a significant increase in lysosomal pH was observed, whereas
WT SH-SY5Y cells maintained lysosomal pH in both fed and
starved conditions (Fig. 1B). This result agrees with previous
findings in TMEM 175 KO macrophage, and is expected given
universal expression of TMEM175 in lysosomes throughout
multiple tissues. Protein levels of lysosomal aspartyl protease,
CTSD, and cysteine protease, cathepsin B (CTSB), were significantly decreased in TMEM175 KO cells relative to WT both in fed
and starved conditions (Fig. 1D), suggesting lysosomal dysfunction. Faster migration of lysosome-associated membrane glycoprotein 1 (LAMP1) was also observed in TMEM175 KO cells
relative to WT potentially by deglycosylation or proteolytic cleavage that could lead to their instability (Fig. 1D, second row) (30,
31). TMEM175 KO did not change the number of LAMP1+
lysosomes (Fig. 1C). Further evaluation of the activities of these
lysosomal enzymes revealed that CTSD, CTSB, and GBA, another lysosomal hydrolase linked to PD, were significantly decreased by 20–30% in TMEM175 KO compared with WT, as
indicated by the smaller rate constant (k) (Fig. 1 E–G). Starvation did not further amplify the degree of enzyme activity reduction
between WT and KO. This finding would suggest that additional
mechanisms (beyond impaired pH regulation) may play a role in the
reduced enzyme activity resulting from TMEM175 KO. Consistent with
decreased activities of proteases, the rate of L-Homopropargylglycine
(HPG)-labeled protein degradation was decreased in KO relative to
WT (Fig. 1H).
We confirmed these results in primary rat hippocampal neuronal cultures. Transient knockdown (KD) of TMEM175 in
primary neurons by siRNA (Fig. S1A) led to unstable pH compared with control siRNA, consistent with the above result in
SH-SY5Y (Fig. S1B). TMEM175 knockdown did not affect the
number of LAMP1+ lysosomal counts (Fig. S1C). Depletion of
TMEM175 also significantly decreased enzyme activity of CTSD,
CTSB, and GBA by 20–35% relative to controls (Fig. S1 E–G),
even though only CTSB protein level was decreased in TMEM175-
depleted rat hippocampal neurons (Fig. S1D). This result could be
because of a transient knockdown in this model instead of complete
KO of TMEM175 in SH-SY5Y. The degradation rate of HPGlabeled proteins was also lower in TMEM175-depleted cells compared with controls (Fig. S1H). Taken together these results indicate
that TMEM175 plays critical role in maintaining lysosomal pH and
proper lysosomal enzyme function in neuronal cells.

autophagy cargos through fusion with autophagosomes at the final
step of autophagy. Digestion of engulfed materials is important for
recycling amino acids and preventing the accumulation of aggregated proteins and aged organelles (14, 32). To determine if
TMEM175 deficiency affects the process of autophagy, we
evaluated the fusion of autophagosome to lysosome. To monitor
the autophagosome, a RFP–GFP–LC3 construct was transiently
transfected into TMEM175 KO SH-SY5Y cells. The signal of
autophagosome-associated LC3 under fed conditions was evaluated. In this assay, pH-sensitive GFP signal (Fig. 2, green) is
quenched by the acidic environment of lysosomes, although RFP
signal (Fig. 2, red) is pH-insensitive. Thus, autophagosomes (AP,
not fused to lysosomes) are marked by both GFP and RFP,
whereas autophagolysosome (APL, fused to lysosomes) are
marked only by RFP (Fig. 2A). The number of GFP puncta was
significantly decreased in TMEM175 KO cells relative to WT
cells, whereas the number of the total puncta mildly decreased,
resulting in an overall decreased GFP (AP) and increased RFPonly (APL) puncta relative to total puncta (Fig. 2 B and C). This
result suggests that a larger portion of autophagosomes are fused
to lysosomes in TMEM175 KO cells, consistent with the previous
finding that deficiency of TMEM175 leads to accelerated fusion
of autophagosomes to lysosomes in RAW246.7 macrophage
(29). To further determine whether TMEM175 deficiency affects
the completion of autophagy, clearance of autophagy substrates
was assessed. The endogenous level of microtubule-associated
protein 1A/1B-light chain 3-II (LC3-II), which increases upon
initiation of autophagy and is degraded as a part of autophagic
cargo, was evaluated at multiple time points by Western blotting
or immunocytochemistry in the absence and the presence of
bafilomycin A. Without bafilomycin, autophagosome LC3 formation upon starvation (LC3-II/I ratio or LC3 puncta) peaked at
1 h and decreased afterward in WT, whereas there was a delayed
degradation of LC3 in TMEM175 KO cells (Fig. 2 D and E and
Fig. S2A), resulting in a significant increase in LC3 levels in
TMEM175 KO cells relative to control at 3 and 5 h after starvation (Fig. 2 F and G, Upper). Adding bafilomycin resulted in
accumulation of LC3 over time after the initiation of starvation
to the same degree in both WT and TMEM175 KO cells,
eliminating the difference in LC3 levels between WT and
TMEM175 KO cells (Fig. 2 D and E and Fig. S2A) (+BafA1).
This result indicates that reduction of LC3 in WT was indeed
because of lysosomal degradation, and that inefficient lysosomal
clearance of autophagosome but not autophagosome biogenesis
was the cause of increased LC3 levels in TMEM175-deficient
cells. Similarly, in rat primary hippocampal neurons, the autophagy substrate sequestosome1 (p62), as well as LC3 levels, were
increased in TMEM175-depleted cells relative to control hippocampal neurons in both fed and starved conditions by immunocytochemistry (Fig. 2 F and G, Lower). Protein levels
determined by Western blotting confirmed these findings (Fig.
S2B), suggesting accumulation of autophagosomes. Given that
the number of total autophagosomes is mildly decreased in
TMEM175-depleted cells, increase levels of autophagosome
substrates suggests that completion of autophagy is stalled because of impaired lysosomal degradation.
TMEM175 Deficiency Decreases Mitochondrial Respiration. Autophagy regulates mitochondrial turnover through multiple
mechanisms of mitophagy, which establish energetic homeostasis
and prevent mitochondrial aging in response to environmental
cues (14, 33). Inhibition of autophagy can lead to decreased
mitochondrial respiration through accumulation of dysfunctional
mitochondria and deficits in metabolic substrates (34, 35). To
determine whether decreased clearance of autophagosomes in
TMEM175-deficient cells also affects mitochondrial energetic
capacity, we measured mitochondrial oxygen consumption rate
(OCR). There were significant decreases in basal as well as
maximal mitochondrial OCR in TMEM175 KO SH-SY5Y cells
relative to WT cells (Fig. 3 A and B). Maximal OCR was determined from the difference between carbonyl cyanide-p-trifluoromethoxyphenylhydrazone (FCCP)-induced OCR and
Oligomycin A-induced OCR. Oligomycin A inhibited complex V
of the electron transport chain to decrease oxygen consumption
to a similar degree between TMEM175 KO and WT cells.
Therefore, maximal OCR was reduced primarily because of a
decrease in uncoupled respiration induced by a range of FCCP
concentrations (Fig. S3 A and B), which cause maximal electron
transfer through the electron transport chain independent of
ATP synthesis. This finding indicates considerably compromised

respiratory capacity in TMEM175-deficient cells compared with
WT cells. Transient depletion of TMEM175 (siTM175) in rat
hippocampal neurons also led to decrease in maximal OCR (Fig.
S3 C and D), although to a lesser degree than complete KO.
Consistent with this result, total ATP levels were decreased in
TMEM175-depleted cells relative to controls because of a decrease in mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation (Fig. 3C and
Fig. S3E). In primary neurons, this decrease also coincides with
reductions of MitoTracker staining, which accumulates in active
mitochondria, particularly in neurites, suggesting diminished
migratory ability of active mitochondria (Fig. 3 D and E). Because TMEM175 is localized to lysosomes and endosomes, and
does not appear to be expressed in mitochondria as shown by
MitoFates (36) and MitoCarta (37) prediction of mitochondrial
localization, decreased respiration is likely mediated by lysosomal impairment. Together, these findings suggest that reduction of TMEM175 expression leads to deficits in energy
homeostasis through impaired lysosome-mediated mitophagy.
TMEM175 Deficiency Increases Phosphorylated α-Synuclein Aggregates
in Rat Primary Hippocampal Neurons. Impaired completion of
autophagy in TMEM175-deficient cells strongly suggests that
TMEM175 might influence α-synuclein aggregation, the clearance of which is often mediated by autophagy. To determine if
TMEM175 plays a role in α-synuclein aggregation, we used a
previously published method of seeding preformed α-synuclein
fibrils (PFF) (38, 39) in rat hippocampal neuronal cultures. In this
model, exogenously provided human α-synuclein PFF recruits
endogenously expressed rat α-synuclein, which is essential to form
aggregates that are characterized by hyperphosphorylation and
detergent insolubility. Rat hippocampal neurons were seeded
with human α-synuclein PFF after preinfection with lentiviral
control shRNA (shCTL) or TMEM175 shRNA (shTM175) and
incubated for an additional 14 and 21 d, after which they were
evaluated for the phosphorylated α-synuclein by immunocytochemistry and Western blotting (Fig. 4A). shRNA against
TMEM175, which resulted in ∼75–80% KD of TMEM175 relative to control shRNA in 14- and 21-d cultures (Fig. 4B). In PFFtreated TMEM175-KD neurons, a significant ∼2- to 3-fold (14 d)
(Fig. 4 C and D) and ∼1.5 fold (21 d) (Fig. 4 G and H) increase
in phosphorylated α-synuclein staining was observed compared
with control PFF-treated neurons. This increase was independent
of types of shRNAs used and correlated with the degree of
TMEM175 depletion (Fig. S4A). Depletion of TMEM175 alone
did not change the endogenous levels of α-synuclein in PBStreated groups (Fig. S4B). There was no change in cell viability
assessed by the number of healthy nuclei or metabolic activity in
TMEM175-KD neurons at 14 d after PFF (Fig. 4E). Viable cells
decreased at 21 d after PFF (Fig. 4I), potentially contributing to
attenuated fold-increase in phosphorylated α-synuclein compared
with 14 d after PFF. Importantly, the pathologically relevant,
phosphorylated oligomers of α-synuclein in the detergent-insoluble
fraction were also increased by ∼1.7-fold (14 d) (Fig. 4F, Upper)
and ∼1.4-fold (21 d) (Fig. 4J, Upper) in TMEM175-deficient neurons relative to control neurons. Phosphorylated α-synuclein
monomers in the Triton X-100 soluble fraction were also increased in TMEM175-deficient neurons relative to control neurons (Fig. S4C). Total α-synuclein levels detected by antibody that
recognizes both human and rat α-synuclein remained unchanged
in both detergent-insoluble and insoluble fractions (Fig. 4 F and J,
Lower, and Fig. S4C). Taken together, these results suggest that
TMEM175 appears to play a critical role in α-synuclein dynamics
and depletion of TMEM175 leads to increased propensity for
accumulation of α-synuclein aggregates, which is the key factor in
α-synucleinopathies and the development of PD.
Discussion
Genetic studies have identified potential risk factors that have
helped elucidate biological pathways involved in the development
PD. However, the majority of GWAS-implicated loci contain
multiple genes requiring further work, such as sequencing, integrative approaches such as Mendelian randomization, and wetlaboratory biological validation to establish the causality of any
nominated gene to the pathology of associated disease. In this
study, we have experimentally shown multiple cellular/physiological results that raise the possibility that TMEM175 is at least
in part responsible for the increased risk of PD from the thirdmost significant PD GWAS peak. Cyclin-G–associated kinase
(GAK) is a candidate for this GWAS peak because of its interaction with LRRK2 (1, 40). Lysosomal pH was altered and
catalytic capacity of the lysosome was decreased by the depletion
of TMEM175, as illustrated by the decreased activity of major
lysosomal proteases. In TMEM175-defecient cells, autophagosome clearance was thus delayed with accumulation of autophagic substrates. Mitochondrial energetic capacity was also
reduced potentially through impairment in maintaining a functional mitochondrial pool and providing sufficient metabolite to
fuel oxidative phosphorylation. Taking these data together, we
find that deficiency of TMEM175 leads to increased formation
of phosphorylated α-synuclein aggregates, potentially contributed by impaired lysosomal and mitochondrial function. We
suggest that TMEM175, like GAK, should be considered a
candidate based on functional data. These data demonstrate
links to two established PD genetic risk factors: α-synuclein,
through increased α-synuclein aggregation; and GBA, through
reduced GBA activity in TMEM175-deficient cells. It was noted
in the most recent meta-analysis that two independent signals are
present in the Chr 4:951,947 GWAS peak (1), raising the possibility that variants in both GAK and TMEM175 could be
contributing to disease risk. Similarly, genes in this genomic region may be involved in the same functional pathways.
Dysregulation of ion currents across lysosomal membrane and
lysosomal pH alters lysosomal function, and disruption of channel
function has been implicated in neurological diseases, including PD.
In familial PD, disruption of ATP13A2, which regulates cation
transport across lysosomes, leads to dysfunctional lysosomal
degradation of proteins and autophagosomes via impaired lysosomal acidification (8, 9). Overexpression of two-pore channels,
which mediate endolysosomal Ca2+ signals, alkalinizes lysosomal

pH to specifically inhibit autophagosomal-lysosomal fusion (41)
and are also shown to act downstream of pathogenic leucine-rich
repeat kinase 2 (LRRK2) to regulate trafficking within the endolysosomal system (42). This evidence stresses the importance of ion
current regulation in lysosomal function in PD, and the association
of TMEM175 with sporadic PD would further support this pathway
as a potential area of intervention for disease-modification
therapies. Depletion of TMEM175 leads to unstable pH and the
impairment of lysosomal function via decreased protease and
GBA activity, the enzymatic function of which is also influenced
by the pH of the surrounding environment. Whether the integrity
of the lysosome is also compromised by the dysregulation of lysosomal pH requires further investigation; however, complete
abrogation of TMEM175 resulted in decreased protein levels of
mature CTSD, CTSB, and LAMP1, suggesting that the absence
of TMEM175 contributes to early disintegration of dysfunctional
lysosomes.
It is important to notice that this impairment of lysosomal
catalytic activity also resulted in decreased capacity of macroautophagy,
where enzymatic degradation after fusion of the autophagosome to
lysosome is critical for complete turnover of unwanted proteins
and organelles. Inhibition of basal autophagy is particularly detrimental in neurons that are postmitotic and cannot dilute unfolded
proteins or damaged organelles through cell division (43, 44).
TMEM175 depletion led to accumulation of autophagy substrates
and accelerated fusion of autophagosomes to lysosomes. Given that
the formation of autophagosomes is mildly affected by TMEM175
deficiency, these results suggest that decreased lysosomal catalytic
activity by TMEM175 deficiency also impairs lysosomal capacity to
clear autophagosomes, and thus stalls the completion of autophagy.
Cellular fusion of autophagosomes to lysosomes might be increased, in part, as an adaptive response to compensate for stalled
degradation of autophagosomes.
The impact of mitigated lysosomal function culminates when
cells are challenged with a proteostatic burden, such as α-synuclein
aggregates, which are handled by various mechanisms that converge
on lysosomal degradation (45). Depletion of TMEM175 resulted in
increased aggregate formation in the α-synuclein PFF seeding model,
where endocytosed PFF seeds induce endogenous α-synuclein recruitment and aggregation (39). Importantly, there was no difference
in the uptake of α-synuclein PFF seeds between control and
TMEM175-depleted cells (Fig. S4D), suggesting the effect of impaired lysosomal degradation by TMEM175 depletion manifested
during the maturation of phosphorylated, insoluble α-synuclein aggregates. Similarly, impaired lysosomes in TMEM175-deficient cells
may simply be unable to handle α-synuclein aggregates, which are
also resistant to autophagic degradation, reenforcing the vicious cycle
of aggregate maturation and inhibition of macroautophagy. However, exactly which parts of any cellular attempt to resolve α-synuclein
aggregation are compromised by lysosomal dysfunction resulting
from the depletion TMEM175 remains to be studied. The PFF
seeding model we adopted was designed to induce minimal cellular
toxicity. Hence, we could not determine if TMEM175 KD leads to
synergistically increased susceptibility to PFF-induced cell death.
Rather, we focused on initial processing/aggregation events of
α-synuclein aggregates that we believe to be far upstream from
actual cell death, and more proximal to the early cellular insults/
stress in the disease. As cellular models of α-synuclein aggregatemediated cell death become better understood, a logical next step in
this research would be to investigate whether TMEM175 deficiency
renders cells more vulnerable to aggregate-induced cell death.
It is also important that impaired autophagy might link
TMEM175 deficiency to decrease in mitochondrial energetic
capacity. Direct inhibition of autophagy through genetic and
pharmacological methods was shown to decrease mitochondrial
oxygen consumption and energy production, through accumulation of dysfunctional mitochondria and reduced availability of

metabolites to fuel oxidative phosphorylation (34, 35, 46, 47).
Decreased mitochondrial respiration and ATP generation in
TMEM175-deficient cells could also be caused by these mechanisms. Although the exact mechanism remains to be elucidated,
mitochondrial dysfunction could independently increase the risk
of PD by promoting the loss of dopaminergic neurons through
production of oxidative stress, energy depletion, and ultimately
cell death (48, 49).
Together, these findings establish TMEM175 as a potential risk
factor and candidate point of intervention for PD with both genetic
and biological evidence tying TMEM175, lysosomal function,
macroautophagy, and mitochondrial function to α-synucleinopathy.
