Schizophrenia, a devastating psychiatric illness with onset in the late
teens to early 20s, is thought to involve disrupted brain connectivity.
Functional and structural disconnections of cortical networks may
underlie various cognitive deficits, including a substantial reduction
in the speed of information processing in schizophrenia patients
compared with controls. Myelinated white matter supports the speed
of electrical signal transmission in the brain. To examine possible
neuroanatomical sources of cognitive deficits, we used a comprehensive diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) protocol and characterized the
white matter diffusion signals using diffusion kurtosis imaging (DKI)
and permeability–diffusivity imaging (PDI) in patients (n = 74), their
nonill siblings (n = 41), and healthy controls (n = 113). Diffusion
parameters that showed significant patient–control differences also
explained the patient–control differences in processing speed. This
association was also found for the nonill siblings of the patients. The
association was specific to processing-speed abnormality but not
specific to working memory abnormality or psychiatric symptoms.
Our findings show that advanced diffusion MRI in white matter may
capture microstructural connectivity patterns and mechanisms that
govern the association between a core neurocognitive measure—
processing speed—and neurobiological deficits in schizophrenia that
are detectable with in vivo brain scans. These non-Gaussian diffusion
white matter metrics are promising surrogate imaging markers for
modeling cognitive deficits and perhaps, guiding treatment development in schizophrenia.

Although pharmaceutical interventions alleviate clinical symptoms, such as delusions and hallucinations, for some patients,
schizophrenia remains a debilitating illness, often times leading
to long-term disabilities and severe cognitive deficits (1). Discovering the underlying neurobiology behind these core cognitive deficits in schizophrenia patients may present a viable
strategy to identify biomarkers for supporting pathophysiology
and comprehensive treatment research. Two decades of research have implicated impaired brain connectivity as a source
of functional disability in schizophrenia (1, 2). Delayed information processing is one of the most robust cognitive deficits
(3, 4) and may contribute to other cognitive impairments in
working memory and executive function (4–6).
Myelinated axons in the brain’s white matter (WM) support its
functionality by propagating electric signal transmissions through
saltatory conductance (7, 8). Reports of WM abnormalities in
patients with schizophrenia are common and include reduced
fractional anisotropy (FA) of water diffusion measured by diffusion
tensor imaging (DTI) MRI (9–11) as well as reduced axonal myelin
levels and glial cell density in postmortem brain studies (12–14).
Identifying the key WM microstructural properties that explain the
patient–control differences in processing speed may yield a specific
quantitative target to evaluate treatments of cognitive and cerebral
connectivity impairments in schizophrenia.
DTI-FA, the most widely reported diffusion imaging measure of
the brain’s WM microstructure, represents a simple, empirical,
and nonspecific biological parameter. DTI-FA and information
processing speed are correlated in healthy controls (10, 15, 16)
and share common genetic influences (17, 18). However, variance
in FA values accounts for only about 5–10% of the individual
differences in processing speed (16, 19). Although these findings
are highly replicable, a large proportion of the variance in processing speed remains unexplained. Also, the variance in FA could
not explain the difference in processing-speed function between
schizophrenia patients and controls (9). Here, we hypothesize that
more advanced biophysical modeling of WM through more sophisticated WM diffusion imaging approaches will provide a more
comprehensive characterization of the WM microstructure mechanisms that are likely to underlie processing-speed deficits in
schizophrenia.
DTI is only one of the diffusion weighted imaging (DWI) approaches. DTI describes the Gaussian properties of the diffusion displacement distribution of water in the brain by fitting a
monoexponential function to the weighted diffusion signal decay
at a low “diffusion weighting” (b value ≤ 1,000 s/mm2
). The diffusion weighting or b value is a term referring to the diffusion
contrast in the scanner. The specific choice of a lower b-value
range makes DTI more sensitive to water molecules with high (or
unrestricted) diffusivities. However, the diffusion MRI signal in the
Significance
Advanced, non-Gaussian diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) measurements that probe white matter microstructure across a range
of diffusion contrasts were sensitive to diagnosis-specific abnormalities in schizophrenia and independently predicted patient–
control differences in processing speed. Two orthogonal statistical
factors extracted from DWI measurements explain most of diagnosis-related differences in processing speed. Moreover, DWI
measurements explained a similar degree of variance in processing
speed in patients and controls separately and in siblings of patients. This link remains contiguous across the diagnostic boundary
and was not driven by subject selection or antipsychotic medication. The non-Gaussian diffusion white matter metrics are promising surrogate imaging markers for modeling cognitive deficits
and perhaps, guiding treatment development.

brain is non-Gaussian and at higher b values, nonmonoexponential
because of cellular membranes hindering diffusion and causing an
increased sensitivity to the water pool with restricted diffusivity
(20–22). At higher b values, the DTI model fails to approximate
the underlying signal (SI Methods and Fig. S1). We hypothesize
that capturing the deviation from the monoexponential model will
provide a more comprehensive understanding of the WM biology
compared with only the high diffusivity captured by DTI and
therefore, better capture the biological mechanisms underlying the
processing-speed deficit in schizophrenia.
To test this hypothesis, we used two advanced DWI methods
to account for sources of the non-Gaussian distribution of diffusion signals. Diffusion kurtosis imaging (DKI) (23) is a modelindependent extension of DTI to accommodate for the non-Gaussian
behavior of diffusivity at higher diffusion weighting through the
addition of a kurtosis tensor that measures the deviation of the
diffusion signal from the Gaussian distribution (SI Methods and
Fig. S1). Thus, DKI calculates the DTI parameters, including FA
and axial and radial diffusivity (L║ and L┴, respectively), axial and
radial kurtosis (K║ and K┴, respectively), and kurtosis anisotropy
(KA). We also fitted a biexponential function to the diffusion signal
decay in the full b range based on the “permeability–diffusivity”
(PD) model—one of several variants of the two-compartment
diffusion model (24). The primary measure of this model is the
permeability–diffusivity index (PDI), which is theoretically sensitive to membrane permeability (more details are in Methods) (25,
26). It also calculates Mu to represent the fraction of the signal
that comes from the unrestricted diffusion (and thereby, 1 − Mu is
the signal from the restricted diffusion). The non-Gaussian DWI
measurements are as highly heritable as the DTI indices but may
capture different aspects of additive genetic control over WM
microstructure (27). Here, we compared DWI parameters with DTI
parameters and examined whether they significantly accounted for
more of the interindividual variance related to patient–control differences in processing speed.
The relationship between processing speed and DWI signal in
schizophrenia patients may, in part, be driven by antipsychotic
medications. Our primary interest is to identify the diffusion
findings that contribute to processing-speed deficits that arise from
the etiology or cause of schizophrenia. Therefore, we performed
related hypothesis tests in siblings of schizophrenia patients who do
not have psychosis and who do not take antipsychotic medications.
Siblings of schizophrenia patients share ∼50% of the DNA of the
patients, have an ∼10-fold increase in risk for developing schizophrenia (25, 28), and exhibit processing-speed deficits (29–31). A
successful testing of the hypothesis in the sibling cohort would
suggest that findings in schizophrenia patients are unlikely caused
by antipsychotic medication effects but may relate to the partially
genetic etiology of schizophrenia.
Results
Patients and controls did not significantly differ in age, sex, and
the proportion of smokers (Table S1). We performed DWI in the
midsagittal band of corpus callosum, including its three subdivisions: genu, body, and splenium. The corpus callosum was chosen
for scientific and feasibility purposes (Methods). Diffusion parameters that showed significant patient–control differences included FA (P = 5.5·10−5
), KA (P = 2.2·10−4
), and axial kurtosis
(K║; P = 5.8·10−3
). Radial diffusivity (L┴) showed suggestive associations (P = 0.03) but did not pass the correction for eight
comparisons (P < 0.05/8 = 6.2·10−3
) (Table 1). Significant patient–
control differences were observed for PDI (P = 2.6·10−4
). The
processing-speed measurement showed a large patient–control
difference (P = 8.7·10−7
); patient–control difference in working
memory was also significant (P = 0.01) (Table 1).
Among four diffusion measures with significant patient–control
differences (FA, KA, K║, and PDI), three (FA, KA, and PDI)
showed significant differences between controls and siblings of
schizophrenia patients (P = 0.02–0.007). These diffusion measures
in the siblings of patients showed intermediate values between
patients and controls (Fig. 1).
The three diffusion measurements were entered into a factor
analysis using the combined patient–control sample. Principal
components analysis (PCA) yielded two orthogonal factors, together capturing 89% of the intersubject variability. Factor 1 loaded
on PDI and KA (r = 0.92 and r = 0.75, respectively; P < 10−10) but
did not correlate with FA (r = 0.10). Factor 2 loaded on FA (r =
0.84, P < 10−10) and to a lesser degree, KA (r = 0.43, P = 10−8
) but
was not correlated with PDI (r = 0.14, P = 0.07). We labeled the
first factor as the “KA factor” and the second factor as the
“FA factor.”
The variance decomposition for diffusion measurements was
independently replicated by PCA in the siblings. The two factors
explained 86% of the total variance. The KA factor loaded on the
PDI and KA (r = 0.89 and r = 0.78, respectively; both P < 10−7
)
but showed no significant correlation with FA (r = 0.12, P = 0.5).
The FA factor was loaded on FA and KA (r = 0.84 and r = 0.57,
respectively; both P < 10−6
). The correlation with PDI was borderline significant (r = 0.31, P = 0.04).
The two orthogonal factors, KA and FA, showed roughly equal
effect sizes for separating patients and controls (Cohen’s d = 0.55
and Cohen’s d = 0.57, respectively; P < 10−6 for KA and FA
factors, respectively). The KA factor was significantly correlated
with processing speed in both the patients (r = 0.31, P = 0.007)
and controls (r = 0.26, P = 0.005). Factor analysis was repeated
independently in siblings to derive the KA and FA factors. The
KA factor in siblings was significantly correlated with processing
(r = 0.33, P = 0.03) (Fig. 2). The FA factor was also significantly

correlated with processing speed in the patients (r = 0.39,
P = 3.0·10−4
), controls (r = 0.35, P = 1.4·10−4
), and siblings (r =
0.35, P = 0.02) (Fig. 2).
The above was formally tested in a two-step linear regression
analysis with processing speed as the dependent variable. The two
orthogonal factors were entered in the first stage, and the diagnosis (patients vs. controls) was entered in the second stage. The
two diffusion factors explained 25% of the variance in processing
speed (Table 2). Entering the diagnosis at the second step explained
an additional 2% of the variance (P = 0.04) (Table 2). This analysis
showed that schizophrenia disease effects on processing speed were
mostly accounted for by the two diffusion signals. Reversing the
regression steps, the diagnosis alone explained 12% of the variance
in processing speed (P = 2.1·10−5
). The change, after the KA and
FA factors were added, was statistically significant (F values
changed from 19.0 to 24.6, P < 0.001).
Next, we reran the regression in the patients, controls, and
siblings separately. In all three groups, the two factors explained
significant proportions of the variance in processing speed (21%,
23%, and 24%) in patients, controls, and siblings of patients, respectively (Fig. 2 and Table S2). The β coefficients for the KA and
FA factors were similar in the three groups (Fig. S2). Therefore,
advanced DWI- and DTI-derived factors both substantially and
about equally contribute to explaining variance in processing
speed in these three samples.
Finally, we tested the specificity of our hypothesis by performing
a correlation analysis between diffusion measurements and working
memory performance. There was no significant detectable association between working memory scores and any of three diffusion
measurements that showed significant association with processing
speed in the patient–control sample (r = 0.17, r = 0.10, and r = 0.25,
respectively; all P > 0.05 for FA, KA, and PDI, respectively). The
KA and FA factors also showed no significant detectable correlation with working memory (r = 0.05 and r = 0.10, respectively; all
P > 0.05). Likewise, we observed no significant correlation between
any diffusion measures and symptom severity [Brief Psychiatric
Rating Scale (BPRS) scores] or antipsychotic chlorpromazine
equivalent doses.
Discussion
In the largest non-Gaussian DWI study of WM alterations in
schizophrenia to date, we show a remarkable consistency in diffusion signals and their relationship to processing speed. This relationship is reproducible in patients, controls, and unaffected
siblings of patients. The statistical constructs extracted from the
diffusion signal explained 21–25% of the variance in processing
speed in each group and most importantly, captured a majority
of schizophrenia-related variance. Alterations in water diffusion,
measured using advancements of DWI, may further clarify how
WM is involved in a key neurocognitive deficit of schizophrenia—
reduced neurocognitive processing speed. We identified two diffusion factors based on significant patient–control differences: an
FA factor, which reflected Gaussian properties of diffusivity derived mainly from the fast-moving, free-diffusing water pool in the
brain, and the KA factor, which reflected non-Gaussian diffusivity
properties and captured the variance in slow-moving diffusion
measures, including kurtosis, and the PDI. These two orthogonal
factors explained most of the patient–control deficits in processingspeed performance and were not sensitive to the patient–control
differences in working memory.
The Digit Symbol Substitution Test, a task thought to measure
neurocognitive processing speed but likely also relates to other
cognitive domains, is one of the most impaired cognitive tests in
schizophrenia as shown by recent metaanalyses (3, 4). Our findings
argue that this core cognitive deficit in schizophrenia is associated
with and perhaps, the consequence of the WM abnormalities
specifically caused by a largely additive effect of two orthogonal
diffusion signals. Similar relationships were observed in patient
and control groups separately and replicated in siblings of the
patients. These results suggested that the biological mechanisms
linking WM and processing speed may transcend diagnostic
boundaries and be driven by common genetic influences (18).
Significant patient–control differences were found in three
main parameters (FA, KA, and PDI) of the corresponding
diffusion models (DTI, DKI, and PD), with intermediate values
in the patients’ siblings. The factor analysis strengthened the
theoretical definitions of these models by showing two orthogonal factors that are stable across groups. Each factor
showed similar and independent effect sizes for patient–control
differences (Cohen’s d = 0.57 and Cohen’s d = 0.55 for FA and
KA factors, respectively).
The FA factor, as expected, reflected variance in FA and was
highly correlated with both the radial diffusivity and the unrestricted diffusivity fraction (L┴: r = −0.61 and Mu: r = −0.44, both
P < 10−9
). It likely reflects diffusion behavior of the unrestricted
water pool. Intact myelinated structures can restrict water diffusion, and a rise in the unrestricted water fraction has been positively correlated with the hyperintensive WM lesion volume, a
sensitive marker of demyelination (32). The FA factor also reflects
the reduced FA in patients, which is among the most replicated
neuroimaging findings in schizophrenia (33). The neurobiological
cause of reduced FA in schizophrenia, as in other neurological and

psychiatric illnesses, is often interpreted as the loss of cerebral
myelin based on its correlation with myelin density measurements
(34, 35). Therefore, the FA factor may represent a measure of
structural integrity as influenced by myelination.
The KA factor, however, may represent a different aspect of
neurobiology. Advanced DWI techniques capture the non-Gaussian
diffusion behavior of the slower-diffusing water molecules by using
higher diffusion weighting values. Schizophrenia patients had significantly reduced KA and PDI, which replicated prior reports (24,
36). The DKI technique was previously used to show significantly
reduced KA values in schizophrenia patients (36). DKI is a convenient mathematical representation of the signal and makes no
specific assumptions regarding the underlying biophysical phenomena. Both KA and PDI measurements were significantly and
positively correlated in both the patient–control sample and siblings,
suggesting shared variance with underlying disease liability.
The PD model samples the diffusion signal decay in the full b
range by fitting to a biexponential function and attempts to explain
the diffusion behavior in terms of unrestricted and restricted diffusing pools by the presence of permeable cellular membranes (21,
22). The PDI is theoretically sensitive to membrane permeability
(22, 24); reduced permeability may represent slower water exchanges in axonal ion channels and water pores of the axonal
membrane (26). As such, the KA factor may index a diffusivity
function of the WM, where reduced PDI and KA occur in patients
compared with controls. Their contribution to processing-speed
deficits in patients may point to a less efficient cross-membrane
water and ion exchange associated with impaired connectivity and
signal processing speed. However, this is only one of the possible
interpretations of DWI signals from the expanded b-value range.
There are several other DWI models focused on different
biophysical interpretations of the biexponential fit (26, 37). We
emphasize that the derived diffusion metrics should primarily be
discussed in a phenomenological way without necessarily referring to specific biological postulations of the model features
but taking advantage of the measurements in the extended range
of b values and biexponential fits (37). The strong contribution of
the FA and KA factors to patient–control differences in processing speed encourages basic neuroscience and biophysics efforts to identify the water diffusion mechanisms governing the
DWI signal, especially in disease models.
Individual differences captured by FA and KA factors explain
about the same degree of variance in processing speed within the
groups. The diffusion measures found to be significantly abnormal
in patients were also significantly different in siblings of schizophrenia patients, although the siblings do not have psychoses or
take antipsychotics. Siblings carry increased risk for developing
schizophrenia (25, 38), and therefore, these findings suggest that
the FA and KA factors may be potential endophenotypes associated with genetic or familial liability for schizophrenia. The DTIFA finding replicates previous reports (39, 40), but the findings
from DKI and PDI in siblings are unique. The processing-speed
deficit in the unaffected siblings of the patients is also nearly fully
explained by the DTI and DWI factors, again ruling out antipsychotic medication as a primary cause for the finding.
The diffusion measures failed to provide explanatory power for
the group differences in performance on the working memory test.
The lack of a detectable association between DWI parameters and
working memory does not imply that advanced diffusion measurements are not associated with working memory functions. Our
analyses were focused on the corpus callosum, because it is a region where DTI measures show consistent patient–control differences in schizophrenia and are associated with processing speed. In
contrast, working memory performance may be associated with
microstructural integrity of other WM tracts, such as those that
connect frontoparietal areas and superficial WM areas (10, 41).
To summarize, diffusion measurements that are sensitive to abnormalities in the low and high b-range signal decay independently
predicted patient–control differences in processing speed. Combined, two orthogonal measurements could explain most of the
diagnosis-related differences in processing speed, and the link between diffusion factors and processing speed remains contiguous
across the diagnostic boundary. The findings suggest that these
measurements are linked via similar biological mechanisms and are
not driven by subject selection or antipsychotic medication.
Methods
Subjects. This study included n = 74 schizophrenia probands (54 males and 20
females; age = 40.0 ± 11.6 y; range = 18–61 y) and n = 113 healthy controls (76
males and 37 females; age = 41.0 ± 11.9 y; range = 18–61 y) frequency matched
in age and sex (Table S1). We also recruited n = 41 (14 males and 27 females;
age = 38.9 ± 14.9 y; range = 18–61 y) nonill siblings of schizophrenia probands.
Exclusion criteria for all groups included major medical and neurological conditions, including head trauma, seizure, stroke, or transient ischemic attack.
Exclusion criteria also included substance abuse and dependence and risk factors for MRI, including claustrophobia and presence of metal particles. All patients were taking antipsychotic medications (SI Methods and Table S1).
Processing speed was assessed with the Digit Symbol Coding subtest of the
Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale–Third Edition (42). To test the specificity of
processing speed as a correlate of DTI metrics, working memory function was
assessed as a control. Working memory was assessed with the Digit Sequencing
Test (43). Patients were evaluated for psychopathology with the BPRS. All
participants gave written informed consent before taking part in the study. This
study was approved by the University of Maryland, Baltimore Institutional
Review Board.

Multi–b-value imaging protocol. The data collection was performed in the midsagittal brain region that encompassed the medial band of corpus callosum. The
corpus callosum was chosen for scientific and feasibility purposes. Scientifically,
it was chosen because it consistently shows significant schizophrenia-related

WM deficits (33, 44, 45). The corpus callosum was also chosen because it is
composed of commissural fibers that facilitate long-interhemispheric signal
transmission and shows strong phenotypic and genetic associations with processing speed in humans and primates (46–49). In addition, the corpus callosum
provides the feasibility needed for testing the specific hypothesis. It has a
simpler, parallel commissural fiber architecture, with no intravoxel crossing
fibers (50). The effect of intravoxel crossing fibers on the DWI signal is challenging to model, and testing our hypothesis in corpus callosum aids the interpretation of the DKI and PDI parameters. A corpus callosum mask for multi–
b-value analysis was derived per subject based on the contrast in FA between
corpus callosum and the nearby gray matter and cerebral spinal fluid. Voxelwise FA images were created by DKI analysis. Segmentation was semiautomatic using an intensity histogram approach and manual editing in the
Mango software (ric.uthscsa.edu/mango).
This protocol consisted of 15 shells of b values (b = 250, 500, 600, 700, 800, 900,
1,000, 1,250, 1,500, 1,750, 2,000, 2,500, 3,000, 3,500, and 3,800 s/mm2
; diffusion
gradient duration = 47 ms; separation = 54 ms). Thirty isotropically distributed
diffusion-weighted directions were collected per shell, including 16 b = 0 images.
The b values and the number of directions per shell were chosen for an improved
fit of the biexponential model (51). The data were collected using a single-shot,
echo planar, single-refocusing spin echo, T2-weighted sequence (echo time/repetition time = 120/1,500 ms with the field of view = 200 mm) with a spatial resolution of 1.7 × 1.7 × 4.6 mm and seven slices prescribed midsagittally to sample the
corpus callosum (SI Methods and Fig. S1). The scan time was about 10 min.
DKI model calculations. DKI is a model-independent diffusion signal representation that extends conventional DTI by the addition of the kurtosis term to
account for non-Gaussian behavior of the diffusion signal (Eq. 1, SI Methods,
and Fig. S1) (20, 23):

, [1]
where S(b) is the diffusion-weighted signal for a given b value for the
multi–b-value sequence, D is the apparent diffusion tensor, D2 is the square of
the trace value of the diffusion tensor (average of its three eigenvalues), and K is
the kurtosis tensor. The conventional DTI parameters are derived here using DKI
and therefore, may differ from standard DTI parameters derived from a single
b-value experiment. The DKI fit provides a more accurate and stable estimation of
FA and is generally highly correlated with single b-value FA estimates (52). During
the model fit, the multivariate regression was used to estimate the eigenvalues
for the diffusion (L1,2,3). The three eigenvalues for diffusion tensor were converted
to axial (L║), radial (L┴), and FA using Eqs. S1–S3 (SI Methods). Similarly, axial (K║),
radial (K┴), and KA values can be derived from the kurtosis tensor using Eqs.
S4 and S5 (SI Methods) (36). The DKI model was fit based on the reduced set
of diffusion values (b = 250–2,500 s/mm2
) because of its limitations at higher
diffusion weighting.
PD model calculations. The PD model derives its parameters from the following
biexponential fit of diffusion decay (Eqs. 2 and 3) (24):
SðbÞ
S0
= Mu · e−b·Du +ð1 − MuÞ· e−b·Dr [2]
and
PDI = Dr
Du
. [3]
Here, S(b) is a diffusion-weighted signal for a given b value averaged across all
directions. Mu is the compartmental fraction of the signal that comes from
unrestricted diffusion, and (1 − Mu) is the signal from the restricted diffusing
compartment. The diffusion-weighted images were calculated for corpus callosum (SI Methods and Fig. S1). The model was fit based on the full set of
diffusion values. Additional discussion of the methods is in SI Methods.
Statistical Analyses. Statistical analyses were performed on the primary measures of interest. For DTI models, they are FA and the axial and radial diffusivity;
for DKI expansion, they are KA and the axial and radial kurtosis. For the PD
model, they are the fraction of unrestricted water compartment and PDI (24).
Patient–control differences and effect size of diagnosis. Patient–control differences on the DTI, DKI, and PD measurements were evaluated using a general
linear model that incorporated effects of diagnosis (DX), age, sex, and the age
by sex interaction. In this model, diffusion measurements served as dependent
variables, and diagnosis (DX) served as the primary predictor. An example of
this model for FA is shown in Eq. 4:
FA = A +βDX · DX+βage · Age +βsex · Sex. [4]
Here, A is the constant term, and β values are the standardized coefficients of
regression that estimate linear associations between the dependent variable
(FA) and predictors. This analysis was performed in R software using the provided linear model, (“lm”), function, and the maximum likelihood algorithm.
Differences among siblings of patients and controls. Significance of the differences
between siblings of patients and controls on the diffusion measurements was
calculated using the general linear model (Eq. 4), where the diagnosis (DX)
variable was repurposed to indicate siblings of patients (DX = 1) and controls
(DX = 0). Diffusion measures that were significant in patient–control comparisons and also verified in sibling–control comparisons were considered
diffusion traits of interest.
Diffusion trait factors. Factor analysis was performed on the trait diffusion
measurements that showed a significant effect of diagnosis and replicated in
sibling–control comparison. Factor analysis used PCA to extract linear composites of correlated variables with eigenvalues > 1. PCA yielded eigenvalues
describing the amount of variance among variables explained by a factor. A
varimax rotation was used to orthogonalize individual eigenvectors. The factor analysis yielded factor loadings (correlations between a variable and a
factor) and factor scores (a subject’s standardized score on each factor).
Association between diffusion traits and processing-speed measurements. We calculated the proportion of the variance on processing-speed measures that could
be explained by the variance in the diffusion trait factors. A two-stage regression was performed to probe the multivariate effects of diffusion indices
and intersubject variability in processing speed. Diffusion measurements were
entered at the first stage, and diagnosis was entered at the second stage to
estimate the residual variability. The two-stage regression analysis yielded the
degree of variance described at each entry step and whether the change was
significant. It also produced standardized coefficients (β) that estimated linear
associations between processing speed (the criterion), orthogonalized diffusion measurements, and diagnosis (the predictors). This analysis was performed on the combined sample of patients and controls and then, replicated
in the siblings.
