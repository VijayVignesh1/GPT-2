We isolated the postsynaptic density from human neocortex
(hPSD) and identified 1,461 proteins. hPSD mutations cause
133 neurological and psychiatric diseases and were enriched
in cognitive, affective and motor phenotypes underpinned
by sets of genes. Strong protein sequence conservation in
mammalian lineages, particularly in hub proteins, indicates
conserved function and organization in primate and rodent
models. The hPSD is an important structure for nervous system
disease and behavior.
Synapses are fundamental structures linking nerve cells and it is essential to characterize human synapse proteins to understand the extent
and relevance of synapses to human disease and behavior and to identify new diagnostic and therapeutic approaches. We isolated hPSD
from neocortical biopsies of nine adults (Supplementary Table 1 and
Supplementary Fig. 1a) and performed proteomic profiling using
LC-MS/MS to comprehensively identify a total of 1,461 proteins (total
hPSD), 748 of which were detected in all three replicates (consensus
hPSD, used for all subsequent analysis, except where explicitly stated
otherwise; Supplementary Table 2). These data are a freely available resource in the G2Cdb database (http://www.genes2cognition.
org/HUMAN-PSD). This study was approved by Lothian Region
Ethics Committee/2004/4/16, and informed consent was obtained
from all donors.
This proteomic data allows, to the best of our knowledge, the
first systematic analysis of the effects of mutations in hPSD ­proteins
on ­ disease. Annotation of monogenic diseases from the Online
Mendelian Inheritance in Man (OMIM) database1 was chosen for this
purpose because it is primarily derived from linkage studies, which
are statistically more robust and less prone to artifacts than targeted
association studies. These annotations revealed 269 diseases that
result from mutations in 199 hPSD genes (14% of all hPSD genes).
Of these diseases, 133 (~50%) are primary nervous system disorders
(Supplementary Tables 3 and 4); ~80% were central and ~20% were
peripheral nervous system disorders. Similar proportions were seen in

the consensus hPSD: 155 diseases arose from mutations in 110 genes,
82 of which were nervous system diseases. Although the number of
brain diseases in which the hPSD is involved is notable, these arise
from only 14% of hPSD genes, suggesting that there are many more
mutations and diseases to be discovered by future human disease
genome projects.
To classify these diseases, we used the International Classification
of Disease (ICD-10), and from 22 ICD-10 chapters, four represented
hPSD diseases: neurology (chapter VI), psychiatry (V), developmental
(XVII) and metabolic (IV) diseases (Fig. 1a). These included common
neurodegenerative diseases (Alzheimer’s, Parkinson’s, Huntington’s),
adult and childhood cognitive disorders such as mental retardation,
motor disorders such as ataxia or dystonia, epilepsies and many
rare diseases.
Each disease class is defined by clinical phenotypes and these are
systematically categorized in the Human Phenotype Ontology (HPO)2.
Because HPO phenotypes are linked to gene mutations (via OMIM)
we were able to use gene set enrichment analysis (Supplementary
Methods) to identify the phenotypes most relevant for the hPSD
compared with brain proteins that are not expressed in PSD. We
found the hPSD was significantly enriched in 21 neural phenotypes
(P < 0.05) that primarily involve cognition and motor functions
(Fig. 1b and Supplementary Table 5). Some were represented by
large sets of genes, such as mental retardation (40 genes) and spasticity
(20 genes), indicating that subsets of the hPSD proteome are important
for these functions. The enrichment observed in general disease pheno­
types (Fig. 1b), such as neurological abnormality, indicates that the
hPSD is a neuronal structure with a disproportionately high density of
neural disease susceptibility.
A powerful way to extend this analysis of hPSD function is to examine the role of hPSD gene orthologs in mouse, an important animal
model of human disease. Moreover, there is a wider range of behavioral, physiological and anatomical phenotypes that can be investigated for enrichment in the hPSD. From a database analogous to HPO
(Mammalian Phenotype Ontology, MPO)3, we found that the hPSD
was enriched in 77 neural phenotypes (compared with other sets of
brain proteins; Supplementary Table 6), which included cognitive
and motor phenotypes, consistent with the enrichments found in the
HPO analysis (Fig. 1b and Supplementary Table 7). The MPO also
bridges to cellular level data, where we found that neuronal morpho­l­
ogy (83 genes), neurodegeneration (23 genes), synaptic transmission
(38 genes) and plasticity (41 genes) were hPSD-enriched phenotypes.
The sets of genes underpinning these enriched phenotypes include
components of known signaling mechanisms; for example, in the
learning/memory/conditioning gene set (57 genes), the NMDA receptor and PSD-95–interacting proteins were present, along with other
proteins that are potentially involved in the same signaling process.
