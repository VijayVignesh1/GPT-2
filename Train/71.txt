The circadian clock and cell cycle networks are interlocked on the
molecular level, with the core clock loop exerting a multilevel regulatory role over cell cycle components. This is particularly relevant to the
circadian factor Period 2 (Per2), which modulates the stability of the
tumor suppressor p53 in unstressed cells and transcriptional activity in
response to genotoxic stress. Per2 binding prevents Mdm2-mediated
ubiquitination of p53 and, therefore, its degradation, and oscillations
in the peaks of Per2 and p53 were expected to correspond. However,
our findings showed that Per2 and p53 rhythms were significantly
out-of-phase relative to each other in cell lysates and in purified
cytoplasmic fractions. These seemingly conflicting experimental data
motivated the use of a combined theoretical and experimental
approach focusing on the role played by Per2 in dictating the phase
of p53 oscillations. Systematic modeling of all possible regulatory
scenarios predicted that the observed phase relationship between
Per2 and p53 could be simulated if (i) p53 was more stable in the
nucleus than in the cytoplasm, (ii) Per2 associates to various ubiquitinated forms of p53, and (iii) Per2 mediated p53 nuclear import. These
predictions were supported by a sevenfold increase in p53’s half-life
in the nucleus and by in vitro binding of Per2 to the various ubiquitinated forms of p53. Last, p53’s nuclear shuttling was significantly
favored by ectopic expression of Per2 and reduced because of Per2
down-regulation. Our combined theoretical/mathematical approach
reveals how clock regulatory nodes can be inferred from oscillating
time course data.

The circadian clock is an autonomous molecular mechanism
that controls biochemical, physiological, and behavioral processes with a periodicity of 24 h in living organisms and can be
entrained by environmental cues (for review, see ref. 1). The clock
is sustained by a coordinated interplay of positive and negative
transcriptional–translational feedback loops driven by circadian
factors, a core group of proteins that either possess intrinsic
transcriptional activity or modulate gene expression (1). Disruption of the circadian clock by either desynchronizing the light/dark
cycle entrainment, altering sleep/wake/feeding behavior, or manipulating the expression of core circadian genes result in an increased risk of development, progression, and exacerbation of a
host of disease states, including proliferative disorders (for review,
see refs. 2 and 3).
Circadian factor protein Period 2 (Per2) is a large and multifaceted protein with an incompletely defined domain architecture, whose functional relevance extends beyond its role as a
circadian regulator (for review, see ref. 4). Loss of Per2 function
predisposes genetically engineered mice to spontaneous lymphomagenesis, increases susceptibility to radiation, and influences cell growth, division, and cell death in various models of
human cultured cells (for review, see ref. 5). Whereas the above
findings are consistent with a role for PER2 in suppressing a
cancer-prone phenotype, a note of caution is in order, as inconsistencies among in vitro and in vivo studies have been recently reported (6, 7).
At present, our understanding of the signaling events linking Per2
to arrest of proliferation and to cell death are just beginning to
emerge. We now know that, in unstressed cells, Per2 transcriptionally modulates TP53 and directly associates with the C-terminus
region of the p53 transcription factor (p53), which prevents murine
double minute-2 (Mdm2)-mediated ubiquitination of p53 and further degradation by the proteasome pathway (8). As a result, low
levels of p53 remain present at all times in the cell allowing for a
“preconditioning” state to exist. This primes the cell for a rapid
response to genotoxic stress, which is further sustained by a Per2-
induced p53 transcriptional loop (8, 9). As Per2 blocks p53’s
oligomeric domain, which is needed for the formation of tetrameric transcriptionally active p53, p53’s downstream response to
genotoxic stress not only depends on its availability in the system but
also on its dissociation from Per2 in the nucleus (9). Furthermore, it
is the spatiotemporal distribution of Per2:p53 that, ultimately,
Significance
Cells sense changes in environmental conditions and translate
them into physiological responses that are mediated by a plethora
of molecular intermediaries that converge at critical nodes. This is
particularly relevant to multiple levels of biological organization in
which the circadian clock and cell division are interlocked. Unexpectedly, the circadian rhythms of two critical components of
the interlocked system, Period 2 (Per2) and p53, were in antiphase.
This finding was analyzed using a systematic modeling approach,
and predictions of the model were validated by experimental
studies that revealed a distinct and complex scenario. Accordingly,
we show that the spatiotemporal organization of Per2:p53 interactions and the nature of their chemical modifications are critical
for their time-dependent subcellular redistribution and potential
biological functions.

provides the unifying framework with which to understand the link
between the two components of our initial model. These findings
place Per2 as a component of the checkpoint response by intersecting the p53 node, thus providing a mechanistic account for some
of the Per2-associated growth inhibitory and proliferative phenotypes observed in cultured cells and in knockout animals, respectively, where endogenous levels of Per2 were experimentally
modulated (10–12).
Using an approach that combines mathematical modeling of
the protein interaction network with targeted experiments, we
established the asymmetric distribution of Per2:p53 in the cell
and its impact on the time-dependent regulatory mechanism that
modulates p53’s rhythmic behavior, stability, and cellular distribution. Our models and data further revealed the relevance of
posttranslational modification events that take place in separate
cellular compartments and that contribute to the time-dependent
phase shift in the accumulation of p53 proteins.
Results
Rhythmic Accumulation of p53 and Per2 Are Noticeably Out-of-Phase.
The observation that Per2 binding to p53 favors its stability by
preventing Mdm2-mediated polyubiquitination of p53 prompted
us to investigate whether p53 oscillation closely follows Per2
rhythms (Fig. 1A). Accordingly, extracts from circadian synchronized human colorectal carcinoma-116 (HCT116) cells were monitored for their level of expression of Per2, chryptochrome 1 (Cry1),
Mdm2, and p53 proteins in a time-dependent fashion (Fig. 1A,
Upper). As expected, Cry1 and Per2 undergo similar oscillations,
albeit with a short delay, with a periodicity of about 24 h, following
their mRNA by a few hours (Fig. 1B and Fig. S1A). Importantly,
p53 was comparatively low at 0–4 h post serum shock, rose to a
maximum at 12–16 h, and slowly decreased afterward (Fig. 1A).
Thus, the peaks of Per2 and p53 expression in total cell extracts
(named Per2te and p53te hereafter) is shifted by ∼8 h (out-ofphase), and the amplitude of the p53 peak is reduced compared
with that of Per2 (Fig. 1A, Lower). Moreover, the out-of-phase
relationship between Per2 and p53 remains a prevalent feature
among cell-based systems and in response to different circadian
stimuli as is the case, for example, in HeLa cells and with treatments such as dexamethasone (Fig. S1 B and C).
Next, we investigated whether p53 rhythms stem from the
rhythmic transcription of TP53 or, instead, its negative regulator,
the E3 ubiquitin protein ligase Mdm2. In contrast to the strong
rhythmically expressed changes observed for PER2 mRNA (Fig.
1B), quantitative RT-PCRs (qRT-PCRs) exposed very weak
rhythmic levels of the TP53 transcript. This was not unexpected
as TP53’s transcript half-life is ∼9 h, which is much greater than
that of Per2 (∼0.7 h) (13–15). Therefore, as the half-life of p53
protein is much shorter (∼2 h) than its mRNA (8), circadian
modulation of p53 is likely to be more effective at the protein
level than at the gene expression level. Furthermore, taking into
account that the peak of the p53 protein precedes that of its
transcript, it is unlikely that the rhythms in protein level result
from rhythms in gene expression. Last, we examined whether
antiphase expression of Mdm2 could drive the rhythmic accumulation of p53. Accordingly, detection of Mdm2 levels was by
immunoblotting, and quantitative studies were carried out using
JTK_CYCLE, a nonparametric algorithm testing rhythmicity (Fig.
1A and Table S1) (16). Whereas our results confirm the absence of
rhythmic levels of Mdm2, a note of caution should be raised, as
other scenarios involving Mdm2 cannot be excluded (e.g., posttranslational events, subcellular localization) that might contribute
to the observed pattern of p53 expression.
These findings further motivate the search for the formation
of the Per2:p53 complex in extracts from synchronized cells.
Accordingly, we examined how Per2 and p53’s phase relationship
impact the formation of the Per2:p53 complex over time. Extracts from circadian synchronized HCT116 cells were analyzed
for the presence of total Per2 levels and endogenous Per2:p53
and Per2:Cry1 complexes by immunoprecipitation (Fig. 1C and
Fig. S1 D and E). The Per2:p53 complex showed a peak at 8–16 h
after synchronization (Fig. 1C, Lower), which is in clear contrast with the level of total Per2 detected in cell extracts (Fig.
1C, Upper) and is shifted from that of Per2:Cry1 (Fig. S1E),
which is depicted in the quantitative profile. Because Per2 stabilizes p53 (8), the lack of correspondence between the Per2
peak and both the p53 (Fig. 1A) and Per2:p53 (Fig. 1C) peaks in
total extracts implies the existence of an additional level of
regulation (i.e., posttranslational) that needs to be factored into
our initial model (9).
We then investigated whether the Per2 and p53 phase shifts
identified in total extracts resulted from a complex redistribution
of these proteins in different cellular compartments. The rationale
behind this hypothesis is based on findings that Per2 shuttles between compartments following an oscillatory pattern that leads to an
uneven distribution of the protein over time (17) and that p53 undergoes nuclear–cytoplasmic shuttling in a process that is both rapid
and energy dependent (18, 19). We monitored Per2 and p53 protein
Fig. 1. Distinct p53 and Per2 phases characterize their time-dependent

levels in nuclear and cytoplasmic fractions purified from circadian
synchronized HCT116 cells (Fig. 1D). Unexpectedly, whereas the
rhythms of Per2 and p53 were in-phase in the nucleus, both proteins
exhibited an out-of-phase relationship in the cytoplasm (Fig. 1D). In
context with our previous findings (8), these results established that
the phase relationship between p53 and Per2 observed in total extracts overlooks the role of compartmentalization.
Next, we wanted to evaluate whether the phase relationships
for Per2 and p53 in either compartment were maintained even
when the circadian clock was perturbed (Fig. S2). Consequently,
HCT116 cells were circadian synchronized by serum shock followed
by addition of PF670462 (named PF670 hereafter), a potent dual
pharmacological inhibitor of casein kinase 1 e/δ (CK1e/δ) that
causes lengthening of clock oscillations by stabilizing Per2 (20).
Lysates and subcellular fractions were quantitatively analyzed to
evaluate the level of Per2, p53, Mdm2, and CK1e expression (Fig.
S2 A and B). As expected, addition of PF670 stabilized Per2 in both
compartments (Fig. S2 A and B, Upper) and delayed the circadian
phase (Fig. S2C). This is in agreement with the established role of
CK1e/δ-mediated phosphorylation of Per2 for its turnover and in
sustaining the negative loop (21). Remarkably, and unlike Mdm2
and CK1 proteins (Fig. S2 A and B, Lower), the rhythms of Per2
and p53 were both delayed in PF670-treated samples in a manner
that mimics the phase relationship observed in the absence of
PF670 treatment (Fig. S2 A and B, Upper). Last, the activity of
CK1e/δ relevant to Per2’s stability and Per:Cry heterodimerization
is not a contributing factor, at least under unstressed conditions, in
regulating phase relationship between Per2 and p53. Instead, Per2
acts as the chief regulator (Fig. S2C).
Mathematical Modeling Predicts Underlying Interactions Between
Per2 and p53. The inherent complexity of the interplay between
Per2 and p53 begs for a combined theoretical and experimental
approach to aid in the interpretation of experimental data, to generate testable predictions, and to develop a unified understanding of
the phenomena (22, 23). Accordingly, the phase relationship between Per2 and p53 (Fig. 1) was analyzed in the context of all
possible scenarios in which rhythmic Per2 could influence production, nucleus shuttling (entry/exit), and degradation of p53 (Fig.
2A). For each scenario, regulation types were randomly selected
among positive (+), null (0), or negative (−) interactions during the
model fitting process (Fig. 1D and SI Materials and Methods). As a
result, we found 103 predicted models that successfully simulated the
observed phase relationship between p53 and Per2. Interestingly,
although the regulation types were randomly chosen, Per2-mediated
entry of p53 to the nucleus was strongly skewed in the positive direction among all models, indicating that this event is essential to
accurately simulate the rhythms of p53 (Fig. 2B). An additional
unifying property among the 103 models predicted that the stability of
nuclear p53 should be greater than that of the protein in the cytoplasmic compartment to successfully simulate p53 rhythms (Fig. 2C).
Based on these initial two findings (Fig. 2 B and C), we developed a more detailed and realistic mathematical model (Fig. 2D,
Tables S2 and S3, and SI Materials and Methods). First, we modified
the Kim and Forger’s model used to represent the dynamics of the
transcriptional negative arm generated by Per2 (24, 25). Second, we
considered the ubiquitination status of p53 as it modulates p53
degradation and shuttling (26). Specifically, the dual role of monoubiquitination in p53 shuttling as a mode to impede nuclear import while facilitating p53 nuclear exit was addressed (18). In
addition, the relevance of polyubiquitination in p53, which is
associated with its rapid turnover (18), is reflected in the model
by rapid clearance of p53 in the cytoplasm compared with the nucleus
(Fig. 2C). Third, the model incorporates the interaction of Per2 with
p53, which modulates p53 stability and function (8, 9). Accordingly,
when p53 is prebound to Per2, both monoubiquitination and polyubiquitination of p53 are inhibited (8), thereby promoting p53 nuclear
translocation (Fig. 2B) while blocking its proteasomal degradation.
Next, we confirmed that the simulated time courses of Per2
and p53 (Fig. 2 E and F, and Fig. S3) matched the experimental
data equally well (Fig. 1 A and D). In particular, the model predicted that the differences in phases observed between the p53 and
Per2 peaks in the cytoplasm (Fig. 1D) were largely due to Per2-
mediated shuttling of p53 into the nucleus, where p53 remains
stable (Fig. 2 B and D). In this scenario, when Per2 levels are high
(Fig. 2 E and F; Per2t, dashed black line), the cytoplasmic-to-nuclear
translocation of nonubiquitinated p53 is promoted [Fig. 2D, brown
arrow, and Fig. 2F; Per2:nonubiquitinated p53 (p53nonub), red solid
line]. Once in the nucleus, the Per2:p53nonub complex dissociates
allowing for free p53 to be monoubiquitinated [Fig. 2F; monoubiquitinated p53 (p53monoub), green solid line], stabilized, and ultimately exported to the cytoplasm (27). Consequently, export of
p53monoub results in a peak delay of p53 levels in the cytoplasm (Fig.
2 D and E, green solid line). A corollary to that prediction is that
p53 half-life should be shorter in a PER2−/− background (Fig. 2G) as
demonstrated in ref. 8. Last, the model predicts that the phase of
the Per2:p53 complex strongly depends on the ubiquitination status
of p53 (nonubiquitinated, monoubiquitinated, or polyubiquitinated)
that binds to Per2 and forms the complex (Fig. 2H). Accordingly, if
binding of Per2 only occurs to nonubiquitinated p53, the phase of
the Per2:p53 complex is predicted to be in-phase with that of total
Per2 (Fig. 2H, orange dashed line) in clear contrast to the results

mediated regulation of p53 phases. (A) Schematic representation of potential regulatory nodes for which Per2 can influence p53 phases. For each

shown in Fig. 1C. Alternatively, if Per2 binding occurs regardless of
the ubiquitination status of p53, rhythms between the complex and
total Per2 species are predicted to be antiphase (Fig. 2H, orange
solid line) and in agreement with the experimental results shown in
Fig. 1C. Overall, these predictions provide an initial framework for
understanding what, a priori, was an unexpected observation (Fig.
1A). Therefore, we set out to test these specific predictions of the
model experimentally.
The Localization of p53 Influences the Kinetics of Its Degradation.
The model predicts that three essential properties simulate the
correct rhythms of p53 (Fig. 2 B, C, and H). To test these predictions, initial experiments were devoted to evaluating whether
p53 half-life differed in either the cytoplasmic or the nuclear
compartment using cycloheximide (CHX). Whereas treatment of
cells with CHX (an inhibitor of protein biosynthesis) can have a
biasing effect on degradation rates of proteins in vitro and under
normal growth conditions, and in different subcellular locations
(28), this approach has been successfully used to compare the
half-life of other core clock proteins in nuclear and cytoplasmic
compartments (29). Therefore, HCT116 cells were treated with
CHX (t = 0) and harvested at different times after treatment
(Fig. 3; t = 1–4 h). The level of p53 was evaluated in both nuclear
and cytoplasmic fractions as well as in whole-cell lysates by immunoblotting (Fig. 3 and Fig. S4). In agreement with the model’s
prediction (Fig. 2C), the half-life of endogenous p53 in the nucleus
was found to be considerably longer than that of p53 in the cytoplasmic compartment (Fig. 3B, Upper; t1/2n/t1/2c ∼ 7 times) where
p53 is normally polyubiquitinated and targeted for degradation (30).
Unlike p53, Per2 half-life remained unchanged in each compartment for the time course analyzed (Fig. 3B, Lower; t1/2n/t1/2c ∼ 1).
These results further motivate the need to understand how Per2
shuttling influences the dynamic distribution of p53.
Qualitative Assessment of Per2 Association to the Various Ubiquitination
Forms of p53. We previously showed that Per2 binding to p53 prevents subsequent p53 ubiquitination by Mdm2 (8). Whereas this
interaction provides a means for enhancing p53’s stability and
availability in the cell and for a rapid response to genotoxic stress
(9), our model predicts that other ubiquitinated forms of p53 should
be amenable to Per2 binding (Fig. 2H). To test this possibility
in vitro, we performed a sequential ubiquitination and binding assay
and monitored the presence of Per2 bound to the various ubiquitinated p53 forms (Fig. 4 and Fig. S5A). In vitro-transcribed
and -translated myc-p53 was incubated with FLAG-Mdm2 in the
presence (or absence) of a ubiquitin mixture and MG132, a proteasome inhibitor. Polyubiquitinated forms of p53 were purified and
tested for Per2 binding by immunoprecipitation and blotting (Fig. 4
and Fig. S5A). As shown in Fig. 4 and Fig. S5B, p53 is efficiently
polyubiquitinated by Mdm2 (lanes 2 and 3 vs. 4 and 5, Lower) and,
despite this chemical modification, Per2 binding still occurs (lanes 3
vs. 5). When methyl-ubiquitin, which prevents elongation but not
initiation of ubiquitin chains, was supplemented to the mixture instead, only monoubiquitinated p53 was generated. In accordance
with our prediction, binding of Per2 was detected (Fig. 4 and Fig.
S5B). Overall, these results, and those presented in Figs. 1C and
2H, support a model in which Per2 is capable of associating with
p53 regardless of p53’s ubiquitination status and, thus, contributes
to the pool of Per2:p53 complex whose distribution is antiphase to
that of Per2. Still, much remains unknown regarding the underlying
biochemistry that surrounds the association between Per2 and p53
as p53’s ubiquitination might influence, at multiple levels, the affinity of p53 for Per2 and/or that of its ternary partner Mdm2.
Expression of Per2 Favors p53 Nuclear Translocation. An essential
property predicted by our model is that, to simulate the correct
phase of p53 rhythm, Per2 should positively influence p53 nuclear translocation (Fig. 2B). Further experiments were done to
confirm this prediction by evaluating the influence of Per2 expression levels on p53 trafficking. Initially, HCT116 cells were
transfected to express trace levels of myc-Per2, low enough to
keep total levels of Per2 relatively constant in the cell and
avoiding potential overexpression artifacts (Fig. 5A, Upper). In
fact, detection of the tagged form of Per2 was marginal to the
point that only the addition of six tags in the construct allowed
for its identification (Fig. 5A, Middle, and Fig. S6A). To better
capture p53 distribution, experiments were performed in the
presence of both MG132, a proteasome inhibitor, to block p53
degradation, and/or leptomycin B (LMB), which, by inhibiting
the nuclear export factor CRM1, prevents p53 nuclear exit. As

shown in Fig. 5A, augmented expression of myc-Per2 resulted in a
concomitant decrease in p53 levels in the cytosol (lanes 5 and 6 vs.
11 and 12) and increased detection of both components in the
nucleus (lanes 11 and 12 vs. 17 and 18), an observation that was
further supported by quantitative analysis and statistical inference
(Fig. 5B). Indeed, the converse experiment, where endogenous Per2
levels were down-regulated by small interfering RNA (siRNA)
transfection (Fig. 5C and Fig. S6B), resulted in a sharp decrease of
nuclear p53 accumulation (Fig. 5C, lanes 10 vs. 12 and Fig. 5D).
Although existing shuttling mechanisms for p53 are in place in the
cell (26), our results support a model in which partial translocation
of p53 and its time-of-day cellular distribution are mediated by the
availability and binding capability of Per2.
Discussion
Today, evidence points toward circadian factors controlling numerous processes that impact cell cycle transitions, growth, and
death (for review, see ref. 31). However, we lack a unifying view
about how those interactions operate under normal progression
and how they adjust to stress conditions. To begin addressing this
shortcoming, we focus on circadian components, specifically
Per2, which play critical roles in controlling proliferation by
interacting with cellular factors at key regulatory nodes. Accordingly, our previous findings placed Per2 at the core of the
checkpoint response by directly interacting with p53, controlling
p53’s stability in unstressed conditions and its transcriptional
activity in response to genotoxic stimuli (8, 9); however, little is
known about how Per2 and p53’s spatiotemporal distributions
help to segregate signals in the cell.
Our approach is simple in concept as it combines theoretical
and experimental work and is motivated by an existing conundrum:
how can discordant Per2 and p53 phases coexist in a model in which
Per2 enhances p53’s stability (Fig. 1 and ref. 8)? To tackle this
problem, we used a systematic investigation of models from which
we could infer the interactions between Per2 and p53 using their
time course data (Fig. 1 and refs. 22, 23, and 32). Three essential
molecular mechanisms were predicted (Fig. 2 and Fig. S3) and
validated experimentally: (i) p53 half-life is greater in the nucleus
(Fig. 3 and Fig. S4), (ii) Per2 associates to various ubiquitinated
forms of p53 (Fig. 4 and Fig. S5), and (iii) Per2 promotes p53’s
nuclear entry (Fig. 5 and Fig. S6). Accordingly, the proposed model
implies that the phase difference between Per2 and p53 in the cytoplasm may result from Per2:p53 binding and shuttling between
compartments where posttranslational modifications in p53 take
place (Fig. 6).
Protein translocation dynamics and posttranslational events
are recurrent themes when analyzing the importance of oscillations for modulating cell cycle transitions and for the generation
of circadian rhythms. We know now that what makes the regulation of p53 by Per2 distinctive from others, besides Per2’s role
as a p53 stabilizer, is its dual anchor/transporter function (depending
on whether Per2 is bound to monoubiquitinated or nonubiquitinated Fig. 5. Per2 enhances p53 shuttling to the nucleus. (A) HCT116 cells were
transfected with either myc-Per2 (0.25 or 0.5 μg) or empty vector (0) for 24 h
before the addition of MG132 and/or leptomycin B (LMB). Lysates were subjected to subcellular fractionation, and total extract (Left), cytoplasmic (Middle),
and nuclear (Right) fractions were analyzed for the presence of Per2, myc-Per2,
and endogenous p53 by immunoblotting. Tubulin and lamin A/C were used as
controls. (B) Endogenous p53 was quantified using Image Lab software/Gel Doc
XR+ system and values normalized to tubulin or lamin A/C levels. (C) HCT116
cells were transfected with either scrambled siRNA (mock) or Per2 siRNA (siRNA)
for 48 h before the addition of MG132 and/or LMB. Endogenous proteins were
detected as indicated in A and quantified as in B. In B and D, data are represented as fold increase of p53 (in arbitrary units) compared with similar treatment in either vector-transfected or mock samples, respectively. Values are the
mean ± SEM from three independent experiments. Statistical significance was
determined by t test. *P ≤ 0.05; **P ≤ 0.005, ***P < 0.001.
Fig. 6. A unifying model for Per2-mediated regulation of p53 translocation
and signaling. The schematic representation summarized in this section incorporates our previous and newly described findings. First, we focused on
the Per2:p53 interaction as a mode of controlling the endogenous levels of
p53 under physiological conditions. We proposed this to be a strategy to
generate a stable pool of p53 that preconditions the cell for a rapid response
to a stress situation (ref. 8; upper left corner of the model). Second, we
demonstrated that Per2:p53 interaction is functionally relevant for modulating a p53-mediated transcriptional response in cells exposed to genotoxic
stimuli (ref. 9; lower right corner). Last, we show that both processes are
related and mediated by events that control the translocation and availability of p53 via Per2 in each subcellular compartment over the course of
the circadian cycle (this publication).

p53) in the Per2:p53 complex, which takes place in a dynamic
fashion throughout the day (Fig. 6). We first described the interplay
between Per2, p53, and Mdm2, and how Per2:p53 interaction
modulates the endogenous levels of p53 in unstressed conditions,
thereby generating a readily available pool of p53 amenable for
triggering a rapid response to, for example, genotoxic stress (ref. 8;
Fig. 6, upper left corner). Then, we placed Per2 as a direct regulator
of p53 expression and transcriptional activity under stress conditions,
thus proving that Per2:p53 interaction could be functionally relevant
in multiple scenarios (refs. 8 and 9; Fig. 6, lower right corner). Our
findings bring both pieces of the Per2 and p53 story together by
unveiling the role that Per2-mediated translocation of p53 plays in
generating a time-dependent subcellular distribution of the p53’s
pool (Fig. 6). In a larger context, and considering the functional
significance of p53 in normal cell growth and carcinogenesis, understanding the underlying molecular mechanism by which circadian
factors regulate p53 accumulation could help identify windows of
opportunities for effective chronopharmaceutical treatments.
Last, whereas the focus of our work is in understanding how the
circadian clock drives the circadian rhythms of p53 via Per2, it is
worth mentioning that other p53 oscillations, with a period of ∼5 h,
exist and are generated in response to specific stimuli. For example,
in MCF7 cells, DNA damage triggers p53 pulses that are primarily
driven by those occurring in upstream kinases (e.g., ATM and ChK)
and are sustained as long as the DNA damage persists (33). The
existence of p53 pulses impacts the expression of different subsets
of p53 target genes and, consequently, influences the fate of the cell
(34). Interestingly, even unstressed proliferating cells exhibit spontaneous pulses of p53 that are believed to be triggered by intrinsic
and transient DNA damage that occurs during cell cycle transitions
(35). Consequently, and in future studies, it would be of interest to
investigate the existing interplay between stress-induced pulses
of p53 (36) and the circadian rhythms oscillations of p53 (our work)
as both the circadian and cell cycle oscillators are synchronized
(37, 38).
Materials and Methods
Subcellular fractionation was performed essentially as described (39). Nuclear
and cytoplasmic fractions from synchronized HCT116 cells were analyzed for
expression of endogenous proteins by immunoblotting following standard
procedures (8). When indicated, immunoprecipitation of endogenous Per2 and
p53 from nuclei and cytoplasmic fractions were from 8 × 106 and 2 × 106 cells,
respectively. To measure protein half-life, fractions were obtained from HCT116
cells collected after CHX (100 μg/mL) addition (t = 0). Endogenous protein levels
were determined by immunoblotting and quantitated using the ImageJ software, version 1.45 [NIH software package (40)] or Image Lab Software followed
by detection using Gel Doc XR+ System (Bio-Rad). For mathematical modeling,
we extended a previous model of the intracellular mammalian circadian clock
(24, 25) to describe interactions between p53 and Per2 (Fig. 2 A and D). Refer to
SI Materials and Methods and Table S4 for technical details and Tables S2 and S3
for a list of variables and parameters used in modeling, respectively.
