In the vertebrate retina, three types of photoreceptors—visual
photoreceptor cones and rods and the intrinsically photosensitive
retinal ganglion cells (ipRGCs)—converged through evolution to
detect light and regulate image- and nonimage-forming activities
such as photic entrainment of circadian rhythms, pupillary light
reflexes, etc. ipRGCs express the nonvisual photopigment melanopsin (OPN4), encoded by two genes: the Xenopus (Opn4x) and
mammalian (Opn4m) orthologs. In the chicken retina, both OPN4
proteins are found in ipRGCs, and Opn4x is also present in retinal
horizontal cells (HCs), which connect with visual photoreceptors.
Here we investigate the intrinsic photosensitivity and functioning
of HCs from primary cultures of embryonic retinas at day 15 by
using calcium fluorescent fluo4 imaging, pharmacological inhibitory treatments, and Opn4x knockdown. Results show that HCs
are avian photoreceptors with a retinal-based OPN4X photopigment conferring intrinsic photosensitivity. Light responses in HCs
appear to be driven through an ancient type of phototransduction
cascade similar to that in rhabdomeric photoreceptors involving a
G-protein q, the activation of phospholipase C, calcium mobilization, and the release of the inhibitory neurotransmitter GABA.
Based on their intrinsic photosensitivity, HCs may have a key dual
function in the retina of vertebrates, potentially regulating nonvisual
tasks together with their sister cells, ipRGCs, and with visual photoreceptors, modulating lateral interactions and retinal processing.

n the vertebrate retina, photoreceptors can be classified according to their function as canonical or noncanonical. The first
group comprises specialized ciliary retinal neurons, cones, and
rods in the outer retina, which participate in the image-forming
processes associated with day/night vision. The second group is
composed of intrinsically photosensitive retinal ganglion cells
(ipRGCs) in the inner retina, which preferentially participate in
the processing of photic inputs related to nonimage-forming
tasks (photic synchronization of circadian rhythms, pupillary
light reflexes, inhibition of pineal melatonin, etc.) (1–7). The
photopigment melanopsin (OPN4) (1) confers photosensitivity
to ipRGCs as clearly shown through later experiments with
OPN4 knockout mice or OPN4 heterologous expression in
nonretinal cells for loss or gain of function, respectively (8–11).
Through evolution, OPN4 appears to have been encoded by at
least two genes in vertebrates: Opn4x and Opn4m, the Xenopus
and mammalian ortholog genes, respectively (12). Interestingly,
the first-appearing vertebrates, nonmammals including fish,
amphibians, and birds, possess both Opn4 genes whereas mammals only have Opn4m. Evidence suggests that during the course
of evolution, mammals lost some visual opsins and Opn4x as they
entered the nocturnal niche. In the chicken retina, different
laboratories have reported the expression of Opn4 genes in outer
nuclear, inner nuclear, and ganglion cell layer (GCL) cells (12–
21). At the protein level, OPN4M was shown to be restricted to
ipRGCs, whereas OPN4X was found in the GCL at embryo day
8 (E8) but mostly in PROX1 (+) horizontal cells (HCs) by E15 (21);
the homeobox gene PROX1 is a universal HC marker that is
expressed from E8 forward (22, 23). These and other experiments
raised a crucial question: Can Opn4x (+) HCs intrinsically respond
to light? HCs are retinal interneurons lying adjacent to the outer
plexiform layer and implicated in visual perception and the regulation of signaling between cones, rods, and bipolar cells, enhancing image contrast, color discrimination, and light adaptation.
HCs are involved mainly in the lateral interactions of the outer
retina (24, 25). Once determined, retinal HC precursors migrate,
differentiate, and express a set of specific markers; the final inner
nuclear positioning occurs around E15 (23, 26), the same time at
which a very strong expression of OPN4X was observed (21).
Molecular comparative biology indicates that rods and cones have
evolved from a common ciliary photoreceptor precursor, whereas
RGCs, amacrine cells, and HCs may have evolved from a common
precursor with rhabdomeric photoreceptors (27). Two studies provide strong evidence of photoresponses in HCs in teleosts (28, 29),
shown to express vertebrate ancient (VA) opsin and OPN4 and to
intrinsically respond to light well beyond rod and cone responses
(28–31). In this work we investigated the intrinsic photosensitivity of
HCs from embryonic avian retina, the role of the nonvisual photopigment Opn4x in these photic responses, and the neurochemical
features of the events triggered by the light stimuli.

Significance
In the vertebrate retina, three types of photoreceptors—visual
photoreceptor cones and rods and intrinsically photosensitive
retinal ganglion cells (ipRGCs)—converged through evolution to
detect light and regulate image- and nonimage-forming activities. ipRGCs express the photopigment melanopsin (OPN4), encoded by two genes: the Xenopus (Opn4x) and mammalian
(Opn4m) orthologs. In the chicken retina, both OPN4 proteins are
found in ipRGCs. Opn4x is also present in retinal horizontal cells
(HCs) connecting with visual photoreceptors. We show that HCs
displaying intrinsic photosensitivity constitute photoreceptors
requiring Opn4x expression and retinaldehyde, acting through an
invertebrate-like phototransduction cascade and GABA release.
These mechanisms may enable HCs to regulate nonvisual tasks
with ipRGCs and lateral interactions with visual photoreceptors.

2.5% phase. These cells also expressed PROX1 after subsequent
immunopurification by an anti-OPN4x antibody (Fig. S2 A and
B). Cultured cells also expressed mRNAs for another HC marker,
Islet-1, and for Gq, the member of the G-protein family involved in
the rhabdomeric-like photocascade (Fig. S2C). By contrast, only
trace inmmunoreactivity associated with RETP1 (≤6%) and NF-200
(≤5%), markers of photoreceptor cells and RGCs, respectively, was
observed in the cultures (Fig. S2), and only when cultures were
maintained for 5 d or longer were a few Muller glial cells seen using
the specific marker glutamine synthase.
Retinal cells from the 3% and 4% phases of the gradient also
expressed OPN4x and upon magnification showed much longer
neurites than those in HC cultures, likely denoting OPN4x (+)
RGCs (Fig. 1).
Endogenous Levels of Retinaldehyde Isomers and Light Responses in
HCs. To function as a photopigment, OPN4 requires the presence
of sufficient retinaldehyde isomers as the active chromophore
(6–11). Results shown in Fig. 2 C and D indicate that HC cultures contained detectable basal levels of all-trans retinal. Nevertheless, to evoke significant light responses, 0.6 μM of exogenous
all-trans retinal were added to the cultures in most experiments.
Light response was then assessed by Ca2+ fluorescent imaging with
Fluo4 in cells from disaggregated embryonic retinas at E15 kept in
culture for several days (Fig. S3). When photic responses were
evaluated in HC cultures, pulses of white light (1,000 lx) of different durations ranging from 5 to 50 s were able to promote
significant increases in relative Ca2+ levels compared with basal
fluorescence seen in the dark (P < 0.001 by ANOVA) (Figs. 2 and
3). Responses were further increased with the addition of exogenous all-trans retinal (Fig. 2B). After light stimulation of different
durations, relative levels of Ca2+ increased 50% from 5 s of exposure to 20–50 s (Fig. 3), and the time to peak revealed that the
highest response in each experiment did not attain saturation
along the photic stimuli. Moreover, when HCs were exposed to
prolonged illumination stimuli of longer duration (5–10 min),
sustained responses were observed in intracellular Ca2+ levels,
peaking after 1 min of light onset (ΔF = 1.34 ± 0.06), decreasing
by 50% after 3 min, and returning to basal levels minutes later.
The decline in light responses was probably due to fluorescent
indicator saturation after continuous light exposure. When two brief
pulses of bright light were given to the cultures, separated by an
interval of 5 min in the dark to allow for cell recovery, Ca2+ levels
peaked immediately after the photic stimulation for both pulses
(Fig. 3E). In addition, when light pulses of different wavelengths
were tested in the Opn4x (+) HC cultures, using LEDs of similar
intensities at 395–400 nm, 460 nm, and 625 nm for 5 s, the highest
responses were visualized with blue light (Fig. S3D).
OPN4X-Mediated Intrinsic Photosensitivity in HCs. We next investigated the role of OPN4X in conferring HC intrinsic photosensitivity by knocking down its expression and assessing the
effect of light-evoked responses on fluorescent Ca2+ levels. Fig.
S4 shows that the specific shRNA for Opn4x significantly decreased OPN4X expression (Fig. S4 A, B, E, and F). Light increases in intracellular somatic Ca2+ levels in control cultures
treated with a scrambled sequence RNA (ssRNA) (Fig. 4 A and
B) were completely attenuated in those cells positively transfected with Opn4x shRNA (Fig. 4 A and B; Fig. S4 C and D). Fig.
4B indicates an almost 90% decrease compared with the control
and a significant treatment effect (P < 0.001). In another series
of experiments, when a chemically synthesized opsinamide was
used to inhibit OPN4 activity as previously shown (32), no photic
increases in fluorescent Ca2+ levels were found in HC cultures
compared with cells treated with vehicle only (Fig. S5).
Light-Triggered Events in HCs. To investigate the molecular events
triggered by light downstream of OPN4X activation, we treated
Opn4x-immunopurifed HC cultures with different Ca2+ chelators, retinal bleachers, or Gq protein and phospholipase C (PLC)
inhibitors to examine their effect on fluorescent Ca2+ levels after
light stimulation. The elevation in somatic Ca2+ levels by light
observed in cultures treated with vehicle (Fig. 5 F and G) were
completely abolished by treatment with U73122, a PLC inhibitor
(Fig. 5 A and G), or with hydroxylamine, a retinal bleacher that
strongly affects photopigment activity (Fig. 5 B and G). Suramin

analogs were shown to act as direct antagonists of heterotrimeric
G proteins (33) and reported to impair light responses in ipRGCs
(11). We examined the effect of 100 μM suramin on HCs applied
for 15–20 min before light stimulation and found that light responses were substantially abolished after treatment (Fig. 5 C
and G). On the contrary, when specific inhibitors of the visual
phototransduction cascade were used, such as the pertussis toxin
(500 nM) that disrupts signaling through the Gi/o protein
α-transducin or zaprinast (0.1 M), a specific phosphodiesterase 6
(PDE6) inhibitor (6, 17), light responses were not affected in the
cultures (Fig. S5 D and E).
In an attempt to elucidate the calcium sources responsible for
the light increases observed in somatic Ca2+ levels and because it is
known that 2-aminoethoxydiphenyl borate (2-APB) is a membranepermeable blocker of the inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate (IP3)-induced
Ca2+ release from internal stores (34), we investigated the effect of
2-APB on light responses in HCs; the treatment with 100 μM of
2-APB before light exposure significantly inhibited light-mediated
increases in intracellular Ca2+ levels (Fig. 5 D and G). Furthermore, photic responses were substantially blocked when HC cultures were treated with EGTA (1 mM), a known extracellular Ca2+
chelating agent, before light stimulation (Fig. 5 E and G).
HCs can regulate photoreceptor functioning upon depolarization, and GABA release may be implicated in lateral inhibition (35–37). To investigate its potential utilization as a
neurotransmitter and its release in these cells under the different

light conditions examined, HCs were loaded with 3
H-GABA in
the dark, the culture medium was washed out, and the cells were
then exposed to bright light for 30 min or kept in the dark. HCs
in culture take up radiolabeled GABA from the extracellular
medium under control conditions (Fig. 6), and light stimulation
significantly increased its release to the extracellular medium
compared with dark controls (P < 0.001).
Discussion
Within the retina, HCs project laterally and integrate inputs
from visual photoreceptor rods and cones, providing them with
negative and positive feedback to generate an antagonistic, and
to a lesser degree agonistic, center-surround receptive field
(Scheme 1, Scenarios 1 and 3) (25). Each HC receives chemical
synaptic inputs from many rods and cones and, in return, generates a feedback signal that alters HC neurotransmitter release.
Through this neural network comprising HCs, rods, cones, and
bipolar cells, light in the retina generates a representation of
spatial contrast and visual detection of edges, color discrimination, and light adaptation (35, 36). HC feedback is critical
for establishing the antagonistic receptive field-surround of the
subsequent neuron in the visual path (the bipolar cell). HCs are
thus responsible for lateral interaction and inhibition (24, 34,
35). In the dark, HCs are depolarized as a consequence of glutamate release by visual photoreceptors, which in turn causes the
release of GABA by HCs onto cone synapses promoting a
neurochemical inhibition, proton release, or ephaptic signaling
(35). Conversely, when the light is on, cones and rods become
hyperpolarized, stopping the release of glutamate and thus preventing the depolarization and subsequent HC response. In addition to their typical role in the retinal circuits, in nonmammalian
vertebrates HCs may conserve vestiges of ancient photoreceptor
cells (Scheme 1, scenario 2) as clearly demonstrated for ipRGCs
(2, 6, 17, 18). In teleosts, it has been reported that retinal HCs
expressing VA opsin or OPN4 can intrinsically respond to light
(28, 29). OPN4 is found in brain, iris, and retinal cells of vertebrates (1, 3, 5, 6, 12, 17–19) and highly conserved through evolution (38). In mammals OPN4 is confined to ipRGCs; however,
the distribution of multiple Opn4s (Opn4m and Opn4x) in diverse
retinal cell types of nonmammalian vertebrates suggests a biological function of higher complexity (see review in ref. 6). In the
chicken retina, HCs express Opn4 mRNA (14, 19) and Opn4x
protein (21). OPN4 is an ortholog of the Gq-coupled invertebrate
opsins (6), and the photocascade operating in the OPN4 (+)
ipRGCs clearly involves the participation of PLC, Ca2+ mobilization,

and TRP channel activation (18, 39–41). The embryological origin of these cells within the retina and other molecular features
strongly suggest that ipRGCs and HCs are likely to derive from a
common ancient photoreceptor cell. The present paper provides
evidence that Opn4x-expressing HCs kept in culture in the
presence of retinaldehyde intrinsically respond to light with significant and sustained increases in intracellular Ca2+ from internal IP3 stores but also in part from the extracellular medium.
The cascade depends on G-protein q and PLC activation and
ultimately leads to the release of intracellular GABA. Lightsensitive HCs can provide a plus-local regulation of visual photoreceptor function, further modifying neurotransmitter release
and thus light intensity perception, because under this illumination condition HCs may increase negative feedback with a
much stronger lateral inhibition of neighbor photoreceptors.
One possible function of OPN4 is depolarization of the melanopsin-containing HCs themselves, which may inhibit the hyperpolarization responses of HCs triggered by light-dependent
hyperpolarization of photoreceptor cells and thus regulate the
negative feedback to visual photoreceptors. Accordingly, the
OPN4-mediated depolarization of HCs by light may contribute
to membrane potential regulation in the photoreceptor cells,
modulating visual function. For its part, negative feedback reduces the dynamic range of the cone synapse by diminishing the
maximal release rate of cones. By boosting neurotransmitter
release from cones, positive feedback may recover the dynamic
range lost in the negative feedback. Jackman and colleagues (25)
propose that positive and negative feedbacks spread out differentially in the retina. Their results suggest that positive feedback
acts locally; because there is no evidence of factors preventing
positive feedback from causing runaway, this crucial role could
be taken on by HCs expressing melanopsin. HCs cooperate in
image-forming pathways with feedback signaling to cones and
feed forward signaling to bipolar cells (42, 43). Here we provide
evidence that HCs in culture release 3
H-GABA upon 30 min of
light exposure. Several mechanisms for HC feedback to photoreceptors have been proposed. HCs contain GAD, the synthesizing GABA enzyme (44, 45), and exhibit a direct GABAergic
synaptic connection to ON and OFF bipolar cells (46) and to
visual photoreceptors (47), showing that vesicular GABA release
from HCs is required for feedback inhibition of photoreceptors.
Despite basic similarities, cell number, layer length, photopigment localization, and physiological responses differ significantly
in the inner retina of birds compared with that of primates; in fact,
the avian retina is especially rich in HCs and amacrine cells and
presents higher complexity of interconnections and intraretinal
visual processing. The complex processing occurring in higher
forebrain areas in primates is achieved at a lower level in birds,
within the inner retina perhaps indicating one of the crucial differences between primate and avian visual systems.
Our findings demonstrate that HCs are retinal photoreceptors
expressing a retinaldehyde-based Opn4x photopigment that renders
cells intrinsically photosensitive. In nonmammalian vertebrates
these retinal interneurons may have a dual function, somehow
regulating nonvisual tasks such as those in which ipRGCs are
involved or lateral interactions with visual photoreceptors such
as typical HCs (Scheme 1). Our findings leave many open questions
as to the way in which this intrinsic photosensitivity affects in
retinal circuits or why these sensitive interneurons were evolutionarily preserved in some species. The findings provide evidence of intrinsically photosensitive retinal HCs in birds that
significantly increases the complexity of retinal neural circuits for
light perception and visual processing.

H-GABA and exposed for 30 min to a 1,000-lx
light stimulus. Supernatant was recovered, and radioactivity in the medium was determined in a scintillation counter. Fractional release was
calculated as the ratio of radioactivity released/total radioactivity taken up
by the culture.
