We administered map-reading tasks in which participants navigated
an array of marks on the floor by following paths on hand-held maps
that made up to nine turns. The burden on memory was minimal
because the map was always available. Nevertheless, because the
map was held in a fixed position in relation to the body, spatial
computations were continually needed to transform map coordinates
into geographical coordinates as participants followed the maps.
Patients with lesions limited to the hippocampus (n = 5) performed
similar to controls at all path lengths (experiment 1). They were also
intact at executing single moves to an adjacent location, even when
trials began by facing in a direction that put the map coordinates and
geographical coordinates into conflict (experiment 2). By contrast, one
patient with large medial temporal lobe (MTL) lesions performed
poorly overall in experiment 1 and poorly in experiment 2 when trials
began by facing in the direction that placed the map coordinates and
geographical coordinates in maximal conflict. Directly after testing, all
patients were impaired at remembering factual details about the task.
The findings suggest that the hippocampus is not needed to carry out
the spatial computations needed for map reading and navigating from
maps. The impairment in map reading associated with large MTL lesions may depend on damage in or near the parahippocampal cortex.
hippocampus | memory | spatial navigation
Two views have been central to discussions about the function of
the hippocampus. One view grew out of work with humans,
and emphasizes the importance of the hippocampus for memory
(1, 2). By this view, the hippocampus is important for the formation
of long-term (declarative) memory, not for immediate memory or
for its maintenance by what is ordinarily termed working memory.
The second view grew out of work with rodents, and emphasizes
the importance of the hippocampus for spatial navigation (3, 4).
The suggestion here is that the hippocampus is needed to perform
certain online spatial computations. In one sense, these views are
compatible because spatial memory is a type of memory. However,
a potential conflict arises when one turns to tasks of spatial navigation that are manageable within working memory. What is the
role of the hippocampus in this circumstance?
A number of studies have explored the possible importance of
the human hippocampus for spatial tasks, including navigation.
For example, one study reported hippocampal activity during
topographical learning of a real-world environment (through
viewing films) but less activity during the learning of events that
occurred in the environment (5). Other studies reported that the
hippocampus exhibited more activity when participants accurately navigated through familiar, virtual-reality towns than when
participants needed only to follow a marked route through the
same towns (6, 7). In addition, patients with hippocampal lesions
were impaired at navigational tasks involving recently explored
environments (8–10).
It is notable that the spatial tasks in these studies appear to
involve either encoding of spatial information into long-term
memory or retrieval of recently acquired spatial information. A
question therefore remains about the role of the hippocampus in
spatial navigation tasks that might be manageable within working
memory, which is thought to be independent of the hippocampus.
For example, in tasks of path integration, participants search for a
target in the dark and then try to return to the start point. In this
situation, working memory appears to support performance. Participants report trying to hold the start location in mind and trying
to update their position as they move. Moreover, even healthy
individuals performed successfully only when they traveled short
distances in a short amount of time and made no more than two or
three turns. With more complex paths, participants became lost
and performed poorly (11). In two studies, performance on path
integration tasks was fully intact in patients with hippocampal lesions or large medial temporal lobe (MTL) lesions (11, 12).
There are other tasks that require different spatial computations
from path integration and that place even less burden on memory.
For example, consider a task of navigation that requires following a
path as directed by a hand-held map that is always in a fixed position relative to the body. In this case, there is little burden on
memory because the map is always available. Nevertheless, because
the map is held in a fixed position, spatial computations are continually needed as one moves through space to transform map
coordinates into spatial coordinates in the environment. The
question of interest is whether performance in such a task would be
intact after hippocampal lesions (because working memory can
support performance as needed). Alternatively, performance might
be impaired because the spatial requirements of the task depend
on the hippocampus, and the hippocampus supports certain spatial
functions regardless of the burden on memory.
Significance
The hippocampus has been linked to both memory and spatial
cognition, but these ideas are not entirely compatible. We administered navigation tasks in which participants transformed
map coordinates into geographical coordinates to follow paths
indicated on maps. Patients with limited hippocampal lesions
performed normally. A patient with large lesions that damaged
the hippocampus as well as the adjacent parahippocampal gyrus
was impaired. All the patients were impaired at remembering
facts about the task. The findings suggest that the spatial computations needed for navigating from maps are independent of
the hippocampus. The impairment after large medial temporal
lobe lesions may result from damage to the posterior parahippocampal gyrus. The findings emphasize the importance of
the hippocampus for memory functions.

NEUROSCIENCE
It was reported informally that the severely amnesic patient
H.M. was impaired in a map-reading task when he needed to
follow a path indicated on a map (13), but no details were given.
To illuminate the role of the hippocampus in spatial navigation, we
have administered map-reading tasks that required navigation but
were intended to be manageable within working memory. In the
tasks, participants navigated an array of marks on the floor by
following paths on hand-held maps (Fig. 1). We gave these tests to
five memory-impaired patients with damage limited to the hippocampus, one patient with large MTL lesions, and controls (13 in
experiment 1; 12 in experiment 2).
Results
Experiment 1. Performance was measured as the percentage of
successfully completed paths at each path length (three trials per
path length) (Fig. 2A). For all three groups of participants,
performance declined as the total number of turns in a path
increased. The hippocampal patients performed similar to the
controls across path lengths (F[1,16] = 0.07, P > 0.10). The patient with large MTL lesions performed worse than the controls
at all path lengths (Ps ≤ 0.05), except for the paths involving two
turns. Both the hippocampal patients and the MTL patient were
markedly impaired at remembering factual details about the
experiment (Ps < 0.01; Fig. 2B).
For hippocampal patients and controls, longer paths were
more difficult than shorter paths simply because there was a
constant probability of error at each turn (Fig. 3). As a result, as
turns accumulated and paths grew longer, it became more difficult to complete the path correctly. Fig. 3 shows that the error
rate was similar for turns that occurred early and late along the
path. For example, the error rates for both the hippocampal and
control groups at turns 8 and 9 were virtually the same as the
error rates at turns 1 and 2 (t[17] = 0.06, P > 0.10). Note that a
constant error rate at each turn (5% for controls and hippocampal patients) closely predicted performance scores on paths
of different lengths. Specifically, a regression analysis using this
constant error rate to predict performance scores across path
lengths explained 75.2% of the variance in the hippocampal
group (r = 0.87, P < 0.01) and 64.8% of the variance in the
control group (r = 0.80, P < 0.01). The patient with large MTL
lesions had irregular error rates across turns (Fig. 3).
Experiment 2. Performance was measured as the number of successfully completed trials for each facing direction (Fig. 4). For
controls, trials that began by facing south were marginally more
difficult than trials that began by facing other directions (Ps <
0.06). The hippocampal patients performed similar to the controls
at all facing directions (F[1,15] = 0.41, P > 0.10). The patient with
MTL lesions performed similar to the controls when he began by
facing north, east, or west (Ps > 0.10) but was severely impaired
when he began by facing south (P < 0.05). Several controls and
patients commented that the trials were more difficult when they
began by facing south. One patient commented that “you had to
visualize yourself facing north.” Another patient stated, “you gotta
look for the N [north].”
In both experiments 1 and 2, hippocampal patients performed
similarly on the two test sessions. In experiment 1, the hippocampal patients scored 71.7 ± 6.3% correct on the first test and
80.8 ± 4.5% correct on the second test (P = 0.10; controls 78.9 ±
5.8%). In experiment 2, the hippocampal patients scored 86.7 ±
3.3% correct on the first test and 89.2 ± 3.9% correct on the
second test (P > 0.10; controls 91.0 ± 4.2%). G.P. scored 45.8%
correct and then 54.2% correct in experiment 1 and 91.7%
correct and then 75.0% correct in experiment 2.
Discussion
We investigated the role of the hippocampus in map reading.
Participants navigated an array of marks on the floor by following paths on hand-held maps. Because the maps were held in
a fixed position relative to the body, spatial computations were
continually needed as one moved through space to transform
map coordinates into geographical coordinates. In experiment 1,
Fig. 1. Sample maps from experiment 1 (Left) and experiment 2 (Right).
Participants walked a 3 × 3 array (2.8-m square), following paths indicated
on hand-held maps. The maps were held in a fixed position during testing,
with north (indicated by N on the map) always farthest from the body. The
letter N was also posted on the north wall of the room to indicate geographical north. In experiment 1, participants began by facing north, and
path lengths ranged from one to nine turns. The move away from the start
position (the highlighted circle) was not counted as a turn, so the sample
map shown here consists of five turns. In experiment 2, participants began
by facing a particular direction (north, south, east, or west) and then turned
to make a single move to an adjacent location.

the paths required making one to nine turns. Patients with lesions
limited to the hippocampus performed similar to controls at all path
lengths (Fig. 2A). In addition, both patients and controls had similar
error rates at each turn, regardless of whether a turn occurred early
or late in the path (Fig. 3). Unlike the patients with hippocampal
lesions, the patient with large MTL lesions performed poorly
overall (except for paths involving two turns) and had irregular
error rates. Last, both the hippocampal patients and the MTL patient were impaired at recalling factual details about the task immediately after completing the final path (Fig. 2B). In experiment 2,
participants began each trial facing in a particular direction (north,
south, east, or west). Participants then turned and made a single
move in one direction as directed by the map. The hippocampal
patients performed similar to the controls at all facing directions.
The MTL patient performed as well as the controls when he began
by facing north, east, or west. However, he was severely impaired
when he began by facing south, the condition that placed map coordinates and geographical coordinates in maximal conflict.
These findings suggest that the hippocampus is not needed for
the spatial computations that support map reading and navigating
from maps. In the study, the role of memory was minimal because
the map was always available during testing, and participants
needed only to keep the instructions in mind. In experiment 1, the
error rates were constant at each turn. Thus, there was no cumulative burden on memory as paths increased in length. In experiment 2, participants needed only to view the map, transform the
map coordinates into spatial coordinates for the room, and then
execute a single move to an adjacent location.
In earlier studies of path integration in patients with hippocampal lesions, patients also performed as well as controls, apparently by using working memory to hold a start location in mind
as they moved through space (11, 12). These findings and the
current findings are not inconsistent with the possibility that the
computations needed for spatial tasks are carried out in parallel at
more than one site (including the hippocampus). However, the
findings count against the idea that the hippocampus is the only
site that can carry out the computations.
Our findings complement the results of earlier studies of spatial
learning and memory. In these studies, patients with bilateral hippocampal damage or unilateral temporal lobe lesions learned about
a new environment and were then tested for their ability to recall
locations, navigate the environment, draw maps of the environment,
or make judgments about the distance and proximity of locations
(8–10). The patients were impaired on these tasks, consistent with
the demonstrated importance of the hippocampus in tasks that require the formation of long-term memory. By contrast, the present
study shows that performance on spatial tasks was intact after
hippocampal lesions when the tasks did not require new learning,
as in map reading. However, when a requirement for long-term
memory was introduced in the same context, by asking questions about what occurred during testing, performance was
markedly impaired.
The MTL patient (G.P.) was impaired in map reading at nearly
all path lengths (experiment 1) and at single-move paths when
trials began by facing south (experiment 2). Note that south-facing
trials were difficult for all participants (Fig. 4). In these trials, the
map is rotated 180° from geographical north. Accordingly, the direction indicated by the arrow is opposite the direction in which the
participants should move.
Patient G.P. has extensive MTL damage that involves most of
the hippocampus, entorhinal cortex, temporopolar cortex, perirhinal cortex, and parahippocampal cortex bilaterally [see ref. 14
for eight coronal magnetic resonance (MR) images and detailed
description of the lesion]. On the basis of neurohistological findings from a similar case (15), we recognize that loss of afferent and
efferent connections to and from the MTL in G.P. could have
resulted in abnormal tissue in areas beyond what was detected in
the MR images. In any case, one possibility is that damage to the
parahippocampal cortex is responsible for G.P.’s impairment. The
parahippocampal cortex receives projections from dorsal visuospatial processing areas, including the posterior parietal cortex
(16), and damage to the parahippocampal cortex in humans and
nonhuman primates is sufficient to disrupt spatial learning and
memory (17, 18). In addition, in humans, a region including the
parahippocampal cortex (termed the parahippocampal place area)
was found to respond selectively to scenes that showed layouts of
local space, even when there was no requirement to learn or remember (19). Although G.P. does not exhibit the marked topographical disorientation that has been described after damage to
this region (20, 21), he did poorly in the present study when he had
to operate between different sets of spatial coordinates.
Despite this impairment, G.P. performed well in earlier studies
of path integration, which also require navigation and spatial
computations (11, 12). Moreover, the severely amnesic patient E.P.
(15), whose MTL lesion was similar to G.P.’s lesion, performed as
well as controls at mentally navigating the environment where he
and the controls grew up (22). E.P. was not tested on map reading.
In any case, path integration and mental navigation tasks are not

180° from true north. Accordingly, the direction indicated by the arrow was
opposite the direction in which the participant needed to move. Error bars

the same as map reading and do not require the specific computations that are needed in map reading to transform map coordinates into room coordinates. Accordingly, we suggest that executing
the computations unique to map reading may depend on areas in
or near the parahippocampal cortex that are part of the parahippocampal place area. The same suggestion may account for
patient H.M.’s difficulty on an apparently similar task (13). That is,
his impairment likely depends not on hippocampal damage but on
damage to the adjacent cortex.
Because G.P.’s memory impairment is so severe, we considered
the possibility that his memory impairment might have somehow
disrupted his performance on the map-reading tasks. For example,
he might have forgotten the instructions, particularly in experiment 1, when he needed to follow maps through as many as nine
turns. However, this possibility seems unlikely, because in other
tests involving navigation, G.P. was readily able to hold instructions in mind (presumably in working memory) when trials extended across 15–30 s (11, 12). In other tests as well, his working
memory capacity appeared to be intact (23, 24).
In summary, patients with restricted hippocampal lesions performed as well as controls in two map-reading tasks, when participants needed to transform map coordinates into geographical
coordinates. However, directly after testing, the patients were impaired at recalling facts about the task itself. In contrast to the
findings for hippocampal patients, a patient with large MTL lesions
was markedly impaired at both map-reading tasks. The findings
indicate that the hippocampus is not needed to carry out the specific computations involved in map reading, although it is essential
for remembering the facts about the testing session. We suggest that
the impairment in map reading associated with large MTL lesions
may result from damage in or near the parahippocampal cortex.
Materials and Methods
Participants. Six memory-impaired patients participated, five with bilateral
lesions thought to be limited to the hippocampus (CA fields, dentate gyrus,
and subicular complex) and one with larger MTL lesions (Table 1). Patients
R.S. and D.A. became amnesic in 1998 and 2011, respectively, following a
drug overdose and associated respiratory failure. Patient K.E. became amnesic in 2004 after an episode of ischemia associated with kidney failure and
toxic shock syndrome. Patient L.J. (the only female) became amnesic in 1988
during a 6-mo period with no known precipitating event. Her memory impairment has been stable since that time. Patient J.R.W. became amnesic in
1990 following an anoxic episode associated with cardiac arrest.
Estimates of MTL damage were based on quantitative analysis of MR images
from 19 age-matched, healthy males for K.E., R.S., J.R.W., and G.P., 8 younger
healthy males for D.A., and 11 age-matched, healthy females for patient L.J. (25).
Patients K.E., R.S., J.R.W., L.J., and D.A. have an average bilateral reduction in
hippocampal volume of 49%, 33%, 44%, 46%, and 35%, respectively. All values are more than 2.9 SDs from the control mean. On the basis of two patients
(L.M. and W.H.) with similar bilateral volume loss in the hippocampus for whom
detailed postmortem neurohistological information was obtained (2), the degree of volume loss in these six patients may reflect nearly complete loss of
hippocampal neurons. The volume of the parahippocampal gyrus (including
temporopolar, perirhinal, entorhinal, and parahippocampal cortices) is reduced
by 11%, −5%, 12%, −17%, and −5% for K.E., R.S., J.R.W., L.J., and D.A., respectively (all values are within 2 SDs of the control mean). These values are
based on published guidelines for identifying the boundaries of the parahippocampal gyrus (26, 27). Negative values indicate instances where the volume was larger for a patient than for controls.
One patient (G.P.) has severe memory impairment resulting from viral
encephalitis. His memory impairment is so severe that, during repeated
testing over many weeks, he did not recognize that he had been tested
before (28). G.P. has an average bilateral reduction in hippocampal volume
of 96%. The volume of the parahippocampal gyrus is reduced by 94%. Eight
coronal MR images from each patient, together with detailed descriptions of
the lesions, can be found elsewhere (14).
Thirteen healthy volunteers participated in experiment 1, including three
females (mean age 64 ± 9.8 y; range 47–78 y; mean education14 ± 2.0 y;
patients: mean age 59 y; mean education 13 y; Table 1). Twelve of these 13
volunteers participated in experiment 2. All procedures were approved by
the Institutional Review Board at the University of California, San Diego, and
participants gave written informed consent before participation.
Procedure. The tasks were based on a navigation test described earlier (29).
Participants attempted to follow paths indicated on 30.5-cm × 30.5-cm maps
(Fig. 1). The black letter “N” appeared at the top of each map to indicate
north. The 3 × 3 array of circles on the maps corresponded to an array of nine
circular markers (15.3-cm diameter) placed on the floor of an indoor space. The
array on the floor measured 2.8-m square. A red letter N was fixed to the
north wall of the room to indicate geographical north. Participants were asked
to navigate the array on the floor by following the path indicated on the map.
Importantly, they were instructed to maintain the map in a fixed orientation
with the N on the map always away from the body. Participants were also
instructed to walk only forward (i.e., not backward or sideways). Accordingly,
as participants made turns, the orientation of the hand-held maps was frequently rotated away from true north. Thus, to navigate correctly, participants
needed to continually translate the spatial coordinates of the map into geographical coordinates. One of the experimenters recorded the path taken by
each participant. A trial ended when a participant made an error by moving to
the wrong point on the floor.

Experiment 1. Participants attempted to follow each of 24 different paths (Fig. 1,
Left). The paths involved one, two, three, five, six, seven, eight, or nine turns (three
of each of the eight types) and could start at any circle in the array except for the
four circles at the corners. The number of turns in the path refers to the number of
times during a trial that a participant needed to turn the body to proceed to the
next point on the path. The first move away from the start position did not count
as a turn. Testing began with two practice trials (no feedback).
For formal testing, trials began with participants facing north and standing
on the start circle. Immediately after completing all 24 trials, participants were
asked to recall eight facts about the task (Table 2). Controls were tested once,
and patients were tested twice with the same 24 maps (mean 65 d between
tests). The factual questions were asked only after the first session. The maps
were presented in a different mixed order for each participant.
Experiment 2. Participants attempted to follow 24 different paths, each requiring only one move (Fig. 1, Right). Trials began with participants facing
north (two trials), west (nine trials), east (five trials), or south (eight trials)
and standing on one of the circles in the array (but not at a corner). The
facing directions and the start locations were those that were the most
difficult for participants in experiment 1. The end point of the path could be
any of the adjacent circles in the array (except for the circle that could be
reached by walking straight ahead). Before testing, two practice trials were
given (with feedback). Controls were tested once, and patients were tested
twice (mean 52 d between tests). The maps were presented in a different
mixed order for each participant.
