Concepts organize the relationship among individual stimuli or
events by highlighting shared features. Often, new goals require
updating conceptual knowledge to reflect relationships based on
different goal-relevant features. Here, our aim is to determine how
hippocampal (HPC) object representations are organized and updated
to reflect changing conceptual knowledge. Participants learned two
classification tasks in which successful learning required attention to
different stimulus features, thus providing a means to index how
representations of individual stimuli are reorganized according to
changing task goals. We used a computational learning model to
capture how people attended to goal-relevant features and organized object representations based on those features during learning.
Using representational similarity analyses of functional magnetic
resonance imaging data, we demonstrate that neural representations
in left anterior HPC correspond with model predictions of concept
organization. Moreover, we show that during early learning, when
concept updating is most consequential, HPC is functionally coupled
with prefrontal regions. Based on these findings, we propose that
when task goals change, object representations in HPC can be
organized in new ways, resulting in updated concepts that highlight
the features most critical to the new goal.

Concepts are organizing principles that define how items or
events are similar to one another. Goals are critical to shaping
concepts, by emphasizing some shared features over others. When
goals change, previously experienced events may be organized in
new ways, resulting in an updated concept that highlights the
features most critical to the new goal. For instance, consider purchasing a home. One must learn which features make for the most
desirable home. A young couple seeking a cosmopolitan lifestyle
may organize potential houses based on trendy features like exposed brick walls, a wet bar, and room for vintage record collections. However, with the news of a baby on the way, the couple’s
goals are likely to shift. After pouring through parenting books and
web forums to learn what makes for a child-friendly home, they
may look at those previously seen potential homes in a different
light. Instead, family-oriented features such as whether or not a
home has a bathtub, is within walking distance to a park, and is in a
well-respected school district may matter more resulting in a reorganization of which homes are a good buy. At the core of this
example are the fundamental challenges we face in flexible goaldirected learning. When learning new concepts (e.g., child-friendly
instead of a trendy house), attention changes focus to different
information and items that were conceptually dissimilar (e.g., two
houses with and without a wet bar) may become more similar (e.g.,
they both are close to a park) and vice versa (1). Understanding
how conceptual knowledge is created and updated during learning
is a central question for both cognitive psychology (1–3) and
neuroscience (4–7); however, few studies attempt to bridge these
domains. Here, we test a neurocomputational account of concept
formation by combining human functional MRI (fMRI) with a
computational model of learning.
We evaluate the proposal that during new learning, conceptrelevant features are preferentially encoded into object representations in the hippocampus (HPC). Recent findings suggest HPC
plays an important role in forming representations that integrate
across shared features of experiences (6, 8–10), yet there is little
understanding about how HPC representations evolve when conceptual knowledge changes. Prominent computational theories
posit that concept formation in HPC is influenced by selective attention mechanisms that favor goal-relevant features from our
experiences (1, 11, 12). When new goals arise, conceptual coding in
HPC is reorganized according to the newly-relevant features selected by attention. Two lines of empirical evidence support this
theoretical view. First, HPC rapidly learns (13), an ability important
for updating conceptual representations in the face of changing
goals. Second, HPC has also been shown to activate representations that are goal relevant (14–19). A critical open question is how
the same experiences come to be represented differently in neural
terms as a function of changing conceptual knowledge. We test the
hypothesis that HPC coding, in concert with selective attention,
builds, and updates concepts, resulting in distinct representations
for the same stimuli across different learning contexts.
Participants were first exposed to images of insects, which had
three varying features (Fig. 1A and Table S1). During high-resolution fMRI scans, participants learned two categorization problems
Significance
A cosmopolitan couple looking for a home may focus on trendy
features. However, with news of a baby on the way, they must
quickly learn which features make for a child-friendly home to
conceptually reorganize their set of potential homes. We investigate how conceptual knowledge is updated in the brain
when goals change and attention shifts to new information. By
combining functional MRI with computational modeling, we find
that object representations in the human hippocampus are dynamically updated with concept-relevant information during
learning. We also demonstrate that when concept updating is
most consequential, the hippocampus is functionally coupled
with neocortex. Our findings suggest that the brain reorganizes
when concepts change and provide support for a neurocomputational theory of concept formation.

using the insect stimuli. For one categorization problem (referred to
as type 1) (20), participants learned to group the insects based on a
single feature. For instance, participants were asked to sort insects
into those that prefer warm or cool environments. Via trial and
error, participants learned that an insect’s preference could be
determined by attending to the width of the legs, with thick-legged
insects preferring warm environments and thin-legged insects
preferring cool environments. The other categorization problem
(termed type 2) required participants to attend to the other two
features (e.g., antennae and pincers) to perform correctly. For this
problem, participants might be asked to sort the insects according
to the hemisphere in which they are typically found, eastern or
western. The correct conceptual grouping takes the form of an
exclusive disjunction rule; eastern hemisphere insects comprised
the insects with thick antennae and scooped pincers or thin antennae and sharp pincers, whereas western insects were those with
thick antennae and sharp pincers or thin antennae and scooped
pincers. The order in which participants experienced these tasks was
counterbalanced; half of participants learned the type 1 problem first,
and the remaining participants learned type 2 first. Thus, the same
stimuli were used in both learning tasks, but the conceptual mappings of the stimuli changed across tasks. To perform efficiently,
participants had to learn to attend to different features of the insects
and update their concepts when the task, and therefore the goal,
changed (Fig. 1B).
This manipulation thus allowed us to vary the relevancy of the
stimulus dimensions over time. By holding the stimuli constant and
varying which features should be attended to across tasks, the
features that were once relevant become irrelevant and the items
that were once conceptually similar may become very different. For
example, two insects that were considered similar in the first task
because they share thin legs may become conceptually dissimilar in
the second task because they have different antennae or mouths.
The change in feature relevancy therefore requires rapid updating
of conceptual representations, both initially after the exposure
phase and in the transition from one task to another. Using a
computational learning model named SUSTAIN (1), we created
formal predictions about how concepts were updated for each task.
This learning model (Fig. 2A) is based on two central mechanisms:
(i) attention weights to stimulus features and (ii) conceptual
knowledge stores, called clusters, that represent weighted combinations of feature values and an association to a class label. A
classification decision is made by first weighting stimulus feature
values according to the attention weights and then comparing the
attention-weighted stimulus inputs to the stored clusters. The most
similar cluster is then used to drive a probabilistic decision. Importantly, this model predicts learning behavior through a feedback-driven process that tunes the attention weights to select
features most informative for the current task. The clusters are also
adaptively updated to code for the similarities among the stimuli
that best represent the concepts needed for the current task. In
other words, the model optimizes the organization of cluster representations over the course of learning based on changing task
goals and the stimulus features that are most task relevant.
A theory relating SUSTAIN’s operation to the brain (11, 21, 22)
hypothesizes that HPC forms and alters cluster representations.
This notion is similar to computational models of episodic
memory that link HPC computations to forming conjunctions of

Fig. 1. Experiment schematic and behavioral performance. (A) Participants
learned to classify eight insect images according to two rules through feedback-based learning. On every trial, an insect image was presented (3.5 s) and
participants made classification responses according to the current task. After
a delay (0.5–4.5 s), feedback consisting of the insect image, accuracy, and the
correct response was shown (2 s). The next trial began after a variable delay
(4–8 s). For both tasks, participants responded to all eight stimuli over 16
repetitions. (B) The stimuli consisted of insects with three binary features
(thick/thin legs, thick/thin antennae, and pincer/shovel mouths). The stimulus
set consisted of eight images representing all combinations of the three binary features. The two classification tasks required attention to different
features: the type 1 problem was based on one feature (e.g., the antennae)
and the type 2 problem was an exclusive disjunction classification based on a
combination of two features (e.g., the mouth and legs). The feature-to-task
mappings and order of the learning tasks were counterbalanced across participants. (C) The average probability of a correct response across the 16
learning repetitions is plotted for both tasks. Error bars represent 95% CIs
around the inflection point of the bounded logistic learning curves. The
shaded ribbons represent 95% CIs of the mean.

Fig. 2. Schematic of learning model and model predictions. (A) The learning
model consists of three main components (see SI Experimental Procedures,
Computational Learning Model for model formalism). First, the sensory input
of the three features is attenuated by receptive fields tuned according to attention weights (λi
). The attention component alters the perceptual representation of the stimulus toward task-diagnostic information. Second, stored
knowledge represented by clusters of weighted features compete to be activated by the attention-biased input. The cluster most similar to the attentionbiased input wins and activates the class unit. Third, the activated class unit
serves as input to a decision component that generates a response. Trial-totrial, the model learns through feedback by updating the attention weights
and the weights connecting clusters to the class unit and whether an existing
cluster is updated or a new cluster is recruited. (B) The model was fit to participants’ learning performance (Fig. 1C) and the final attention weights (λi) for
each dimension were extracted for both tasks. The relative attention weights
for each task are depicted in the radar plots (dotted lines show participant
weights, bold lines show group means). (C) Matrices depict the average model
predictions for the pairwise similarities between the stimuli for the two tasks.
Task-specific similarity predictions for each participant were generated by
extracting cluster activations for each stimulus at the end of learning. Pearson
correlations were then calculated for each stimulus pair, and averaged across
participants. The similarity matrices characterize the task-specific conceptual
representations underlying classification decisions. Stimuli in the same class for
a given task are marked by text color on the matrix axes.

experiences (12, 23). Prefrontal cortex (PFC) is proposed to tune
selective attention to features (24–26), as well as direct encoding
and retrieval of HPC cluster representations (9, 27–30). In particular, PFC monitors the similarity between the current stimulus
information and existing conceptual knowledge and biases HPC
functions in reorganizing clusters to reflect goal-relevant features.
In other words, what is attended to by PFC affects what is activated in HPC, and how HPC representations are updated impacts
how PFC-based attention is tuned. Here, we used the computational model to index each participant’s attentional strategies and
organization of object representations across the two learning
tasks. We then used these model-based predictions to test how
neural representations in HPC for the same experiences dynamically evolve in the face of changing concepts.
An important aspect of our approach is that model-based predictions about dynamic changes in object representations were
tailored to each participant’s learning behavior. Using a modelbased representational similarity analysis (RSA) approach, for each
participant, we compared the similarity structure of the modelpredicted cluster representations (i.e., conceptual knowledge) to
the neural activation patterns elicited by the insect stimuli (Fig. 3).
We hypothesized that the organization of HPC object representations during learning would track how the model dynamically
updated its attention-weighted object representations across the
learning tasks. The theorized neural mechanism for such dynamic
HPC updating relies on communication between HPC and brain
regions important for evaluating sensory and internal mnemonic
information (11). Thus, we also predicted a functional coupling
between HPC and PFC, subregions of which have been implicated
in the formation of generalized knowledge (30, 31) and cognitive
control (32).
Results
Updating Concepts Changes Attention and Object Similarity. Participants successfully learned both classification problems across
learning trial repetitions (Fig. 1C; βrep = 0.431, SE = 0.046, z =
9.398, P < 1 × 10−16) with performance on type 1 reaching asymptote sooner than type 2 (βtask = 0.928, SE = 0.363, z = 2.556,
P = 0.011). Type 2 learning was relatively slower for participants
that learned type 1 first (βtask*order = −1.218, SE = 0.551, z =
−2.209, P = 0.027). No other group level effects on performance
reached significance. The learning model was fit separately to each
participant’s learning curves and the attention weight parameters
(λ) were extracted at the end of learning for both tasks (Fig. 2B).
According to model predictions, participants allocated attention
to the features that were most diagnostic for the given learning
task. For the type 1 task, attention was allocated more to the diagnostic dimension λ1 than the other two dimensions (Zs > 4.40,
Ps < 8 × 10−6
). For the type 2 task, attention was allocated more to
the two diagnostic dimensions λ2 and λ3 (Zs > 5.80, Ps < 6 × 10−9
).
This behavioral pattern replicates previous findings (1, 20, 33) and
allows us to quantitatively index attention’s influence on HPC
conceptual coding.
We also examined the object representations as predicted by
the learning model after the concepts had been acquired. For each
participant, we extracted the model-based cluster representations
for the same stimuli in both learning tasks, operationalized as a
vector of values representing the degree that each model cluster
was activated by the stimuli. We then calculated the pairwise
correlations between these cluster representations (Fig. 2C).
Across the two tasks, the similarity structure differed strikingly,
reflecting the change in relevancy for the stimulus features; for
instance, some stimuli that were less similar in the type 1 problem
were more similar in the type 2 problem (e.g., stimuli 1 and 5).
This difference in similarity structure across the tasks was confirmed with a randomization test of the matrices’ exchangeability
(Z = 3.42, P = 0.0024). Moreover, not all stimuli within a category
show the same level of similarity (e.g., in type 2, stimuli 1 and 4 are
predicted to be very dissimilar despite belonging to the same
category). Thus, any neural representations that are found to be
consistent with this structure cannot be due simply to the association between stimuli and a category response. Collectively, these
behavioral and modeling findings suggest participants learned the
tasks by attending to diagnostic information and updating object
representations to reflect the distinct attentional strategies required by each task. The similarity structure reflecting modelbased object representations were used to test how conceptual
coding in HPC dynamically reflected changing task concepts.
Hippocampal Representations Change Dynamically with Model Predictions.
To evaluate the dynamic nature of HPC-based representations
across learning tasks, we measured model-brain consistency with
model-based RSA (34). This approach (Fig. 3) allowed us to
index the degree that the similarity structure of neural activation
patterns matched model-based predictions of conceptual organization. Specifically, we calculated neural similarity between
HPC activation patterns for each stimulus pair after the concepts
were established in both tasks (i.e., the second half of each task
when participants had reached asymptotic performance). The
resulting neural similarity matrices, one for each of the two
learning tasks, were concatenated and compared with the
SUSTAIN similarity matrices with Spearman correlation and a
randomization testing procedure. Using searchlight methods (35),
this entire process was repeated for all spheres of neural activity
(3-voxel radius) within HPC.
The group-level analysis of the model-based RSA (Fig. 4A)
revealed a cluster in left anterior HPC (voxelwise threshold P <
0.005, small volume cluster correction P < 0.05; cluster peak Z =
3.21; cluster peak location: x = −25, y = −15, z = −17; 161-cluster
extent) that exhibited significant consistency with the conceptual
representations as predicted by the learning model. To visualize
the conceptual organization within this HPC region, we derived
attention weight estimates from neural similarity measures and
projected these weights into stimulus feature space (Fig. 4B).
These spaces reflect the influence of attentional tuning with
changing task demands; whereas neural representations demonstrated more attention allocated to the first feature dimension (λn
1)
in the type 1 task, attention was tuned to the other two feature
dimensions (λn
2 and λn
3) in the type 2 task. This HPC region did
not vary in response magnitude across tasks (Z = 0.092, P = 0.927);
all task-related modulation was at the level of latent representation. An additional control analysis demonstrated that HPC representational coding was not simply category based, but rather that

to generate representational similarity spaces (Fig. 2C). A searchlight method
was used to generate corresponding neural similarity matrices within the
hippocampus (highlighted in green) by correlating voxel activation patterns
within each searchlight sphere (3-voxel radius) for all stimulus pairs from
fMRI data recorded during the latter half of the task. The correspondence
between model and neural similarity matrices across both tasks was assessed
with Spearman correlation.

attention-weighting inherent to the model was critical to isolate
updating mechanisms within HPC (SI Experimental Procedures).
Hippocampal–Prefrontal Functional Connectivity Greater During
Updating. We next evaluated the hypothesis that dynamic updating of HPC representations is facilitated by interactions with PFC
(11). We predicted that such interactions would be critical early in
learning, when the need for dynamic updating of the conceptual
space is most prevalent and the learning model establishes goalrelevant clusters. Specifically, we performed a whole-brain functional connectivity analysis to test whether neural activity in left
anterior HPC (Fig. 4A) was coupled with PFC more so during early
relative to late learning. Group-level analyses of functional connectivity revealed that both PFC and occipital regions showed
enhanced coupling with the HPC seed region in the early learning
phase relative to later in learning (Fig. 4C and Table S2).
Specifically, activation time courses in bilateral medial prefrontal (mPFC), right frontopolar (FPC), and right dorsolateral prefrontal (dlPFC) cortex were coupled with early learning-related
HPC BOLD activity.
Discussion
Using a model-based fMRI approach, we show that HPC object
representations are updated as new concepts are acquired; the
same object is represented differently when concepts shift to
emphasize new object features. When task demands change, HPC
representations are updated to reflect new concepts and when
such dynamic updating is occurring, HPC is distinctly coupled with
PFC. Furthermore, our approach goes beyond current modelbased fMRI methods that examine only the relationship between
brain response and individual model parameters. Specifically, we
assessed the organization of neural representations and how they
change as function of experience through the lens of a computational model and an a priori theory linking model to brain regions.
By doing so, our approach links formal psychological theory to the
neural dynamics of learning (11).
The current findings provide unique support for the hypothesized role of the HPC in building conceptual knowledge (6, 12, 23).
Notably, the HPC region showing attention-weighted object representations was predominantly localized to the dentate gyrus/
CA2,3 region. The intrinsic properties of this region (36, 37) makes
it ideal for integrating goal-relevant features into concept representations (6). Although animal (38) and human (39) work has
shown support for HPC involvement in the binding of coarse event
elements such as items in context (40, 41), the current findings
implicate HPC coding at the level of individual stimuli and how
they are conceptually organized. Recent work has shed light on the
organization of over-learned conceptual representations of visual
objects (7, 34, 42); here we show that such conceptual organization
can evolve as a function of changing goals. Specifically, by
leveraging quantitative model predictions of how attention selects stimulus features and impacts the similarity relations among
object representations during learning, we demonstrated that
HPC coding was sensitive to the stimulus features that were informative to the task at hand.
Two recent human fMRI studies (16, 17) have demonstrated
that HPC representations, as evidenced in voxel activation patterns, are distinct for different task states. In these studies,
searching through room images for a particular style of wall art
evoked distinct HPC patterns relative to searching the same room
images for a particular room layout. Although these findings offer
compelling evidence that attention enhances encoding of distinct
HPC representations, the current study extends beyond this work to
characterize how that modulation occurs and to show that attention
influences the neural representation of learned concepts. We
demonstrated that goal-diagnostic information is preferentially
encoded into HPC representations, with concept organization
evolving as goals change. These results, possible only by linking
model predictions to neural representations, provide a substantial
contribution toward understanding the computational mechanisms
that underlie HPC knowledge formation and updating.
Our findings also add to a growing body of literature suggesting
that HPC supports cognitive tasks beyond the domain of episodic
memory (43). The finding that anterior HPC forms concept-specific
representations speaks to the debate on HPC’s role in representing
complex visual objects (44) and classification learning (4). Although
findings from seminal rodent and patient studies suggest perirhinal
cortex rather than HPC is critical for processing objects composed
of multiple features (45–47), the current findings are consistent
with the account that HPC is important for organizing complex
object representations according to changing contexts (39, 41, 48).
Specifically, our results suggest that HPC plays an important role in
forming new concepts; these HPC-based concepts may then be
consolidated into long-term cortical representations of conceptual

representations in left anterior HPC were consistent with model predictions of
attention-weighted conceptual coding (peak x = −25, y = −15, z = 17, 161-

corrected at P < 0.05 for HPC). (B) Stimulus-specific neural representations from
the HPC region in A were used to estimate attention weights to the three
feature dimensions. These neurally derived attention weights were then projected into feature space to demonstrate the attentional tuning across tasks.
Each point represents a stimulus and is colored according to the class membership for the task. The attention-weighted spaces are a visual depiction of
the model-based RSA results (i.e., they are not an independent analysis) and
show how attention is tuned across tasks to reconfigure stimulus space into
task-relevant conceptual space. (C) Regions in PFC and occipital cortex showed
significantly greater functional coupling with the HPC region identified by
model-based RSA during early versus late learning (voxelwise thresholded at
P < 0.005, whole brain cluster extent corrected at P < 0.05).

knowledge, as proposed by prominent memory theories (49, 50).
Indeed, the current study extends prior fMRI work implicating
HPC processes in classification learning (22, 51–53) to demonstrate
the influence of goal-relevant selective attention in HPC-based
conceptual representations. These results add support for the theoretical proposal from the episodic memory literature that the HPC
adaptively builds knowledge representations across episodes (11,
12). It is noteworthy that our findings were localized to the anterior
portion of the HPC. Recent rodent (38) and human (8, 54) evidence suggests episodic memories are encoded according to a
gradient of generalization along the HPC anterior–posterior axis.
Posterior HPC has been shown to exhibit distinct representations
for individual episodes, whereas anterior HPC codes for integrated
representations that generalize across related episodes (8, 22, 38,
54). The current study builds on these observations to show that
anterior HPC representations are not limited to spatial contexts
(19, 38, 55, 56) or overlap between related episodes (8), but can
also integrate attention-weighted object information across extended learning experiences.
Our connectivity findings speculatively support the view that
PFC interacts with HPC when concepts are updated to reflect
changes in the learning context. In particular, left anterior HPC
showed greater functional connectivity during the early phase of
learning with regions of mPFC, a finding predicted by SUSTAIN’s
neural framework (11). These results are also consistent with
episodic memory findings that PFC biases encoding and retrieval
of mnemonic information in HPC (9, 27, 28) and a recent proposal (29) that memories for individual experiences are updated
through HPC-mPFC interactions to create generalized knowledge
that supports complex behaviors like inference (8, 30). We also
found that early-learning HPC activation was coupled with regions
implicated in a neural hierarchy of cognitive control along the
rostral–caudal axis of lateral PFC (26, 57, 58). Speculatively, such
coupling may reflect processes that map stimulus features to goalspecific response and context representations. Finally, that HPC
showed coupling with occipital cortex is consistent with previous
reports that neural representations in high-level visual areas
change as a function of experience (34, 59). Collectively, these
findings speculatively offer a potential learning network that
should be a target of future studies.
There are relevant parallels between the current study and the
extensive literature on task switching (25, 60). This literature seeks
to characterize the mechanisms underlying cognitive control in
switching between tasks with distinct attentional (61, 62) and response strategies. Here, we tested how individuals engage similar
mechanisms of selective attention and control, but within a
learning context. By focusing on how participants learned to selectively attend to the most relevant features across changing
tasks, we provide a formal account of how attention guides the
formation and updating of neural representations of concepts.
In conclusion, the model-based fMRI approach of the current
work provides a compelling demonstration that HPC-based object
representations are dynamically updated through attention biases.
This approach is a unique contribution to the expanding field of
computational model-based fMRI methods (63). In particular, the
model-based RSA method we propose is a fundamental departure
from the typical model-based fMRI approach (21, 64, 65) that
focuses on localizing time-varying model parameters to activation
timeseries of brain regions. Instead, we leverage the structure of
the conceptual representations predicted by a learning model to
reveal how neural representations of goal-specific concepts are
dynamically updated during learning. Furthermore, by marrying
computational modeling and neural measures through the shared
currency of similarity structure, we leverage RSA in a manner that
was an original proposed goal of the approach (66), but has seen
only limited empirical support (34, 42). With this multifaceted
approach, the current study demonstrates that, when goals change,
object representations in HPC can be organized in new ways,
resulting in updated concepts that highlight the features most
critical to the new goal.
Experimental Procedures
Subjects and Procedures. Twenty-three volunteers participated in the study; all
subjects were right handed, had normal or corrected-to-normal vision, and
were compensated $75 for participating. After consent in accordance with the
University of Texas Institutional Review Board, participants performed all tasks
in a 3-T Siemens Skyra MRI scanner. They were instructed to learn to classify
insect stimuli based on the combination of the insects’ three features. The rules
that defined the classification problems were not included in any of the instructions; rather, participants had to learn these rules through feedbackbased trial and error. Participants first performed a familiarization task to
familiarize participants with the insect stimuli and task procedures and to
eliminate any neural activation due to stimulus and task novelty during the
learning tasks. Participants then performed the type 1 and type 2 classification
tasks. For the type 1 task, class associations were defined by a rule depending
on the value of one dimension. For the type 2 task, class associations were
defined by an XOR logical rule that depended on the two dimensions that
were not relevant in the type 1 task. The order of the type 1 and 2 tasks was
counterbalanced across participants. The classification tasks consisted of
learning trials presented in an event-related design. On each trial, an insect
image was presented for 3.5s and participants responded with the insect’s
class. After a 0.5- to 4.5-s fixation, a 2-s feedback screen consisting of the insect
image, response accuracy, and the correct class was shown before a 4- to 8-s
fixation. Each of the eight insects was presented in four learning trials during
each fMRI run and participants completed four fMRI runs for each classification task. Whole-brain fMRI data were acquired with 1.7-mm isotropic voxels
and a TR of 2 s. Full procedures and MRI data acquisition and processing details
are described in SI Experimental Procedures.
Model-Based Representational Similarity Analysis. We fit SUSTAIN, a computational learning model, to each participant’s learning performance. Stimuli
were presented to SUSTAIN in the same order as what the participants experienced and model parameters were optimized (67) to predict each participant’s learning performance in the familiarization task and two learning
tasks. The optimized parameters were used to extract measures of attention
weights and stimulus representations (cluster activation vectors) during the
second half of learning in the two tasks. The pairwise similarities of the cluster
activation vectors were then calculated with Pearson correlation to generate
similarity matrices. Values from the upper triangle of the task-specific similarity
matrices were concatenated and served as the model-based prediction of attention-biased representations. Neural similarity matrices for the stimuli were
calculated by first estimating activation patterns for each stimulus using an
event-specific univariate general linear model (GLM) approach (68, 69). The
neural similarity between stimulus-specific activation patterns from the second
half of learning was assessed with a searchlight method (35, 70) such that the
Pearson correlation was calculated for all pairwise stimulus-specific activation
patterns from a three-voxel radius sphere. Upper triangle values of the taskspecific neural similarity matrices were concatenated to serve as the neural
similarity between the stimuli across tasks. The correspondence between the
neural and model-based similarity matrices was assessed with Spearman correlation and a randomization test. This searchlight method was applied to all
spheres within HPC. For more details, see SI Experimental Procedures, ModelBased Representational Similarity Analysis.
Functional Connectivity Analysis. HPC functional connectivity with the rest of
the brain was assessed using voxelwise regression (71). Mean activation time
courses from the HPC region identified in the model-based RSA were extracted
for each participant and entered into a GLM with the time course as a regressor. The resulting parameter estimates from the first two runs (early
learning) were contrasted with the last two runs (late learning). The resulting
contrast images were normalized to MNI space (72) and submitted to group
analysis (73). For more details, see SI Experimental Procedures, Functional
Connectivity Analysis.
