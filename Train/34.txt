Neurotransmission in dentate gyrus (DG) is critical for spatial coding,
learning memory, and emotion processing. Although DG dysfunction is
implicated in psychiatric disorders, including schizophrenia, underlying
pathological mechanisms remain unclear. Here we report that transmembrane protein 108 (Tmem108), a novel schizophrenia susceptibility
gene, is highly enriched in DG granule neurons and its expression increased at the postnatal period critical for DG development. Tmem108
is specifically expressed in the nervous system and enriched in the
postsynaptic density fraction. Tmem108-deficient neurons form fewer
and smaller spines, suggesting that Tmem108 is required for spine
formation and maturation. In agreement, excitatory postsynaptic currents of DG granule neurons were decreased in Tmem108 mutant mice,
indicating a hypofunction of glutamatergic activity. Further cell biological studies indicate that Tmem108 is necessary for surface expression
of AMPA receptors. Tmem108-deficient mice display compromised sensorimotor gating and cognitive function. Together, these observations
indicate that Tmem108 plays a critical role in regulating spine development and excitatory transmission in DG granule neurons. When
Tmem108 is mutated, mice displayed excitatory/inhibitory imbalance
and behavioral deficits relevant to schizophrenia, revealing potential
pathophysiological mechanisms of schizophrenia.

schizophrenia
Schizophrenia is a disabling psychiatric disorder that affects
1% of the general population. It is thought to be a neurodevelopment disorder, as many symptoms appear or worsen during
adolescence, a time of great transition and refinements in brain
structure and function (1, 2). Consequently, patients display characteristic positive symptoms including delusions and hallucinations,
negative symptoms including abnormal emotional reactivity and
anhedonia and cognitive deficits. Underlying pathophysiological
mechanisms have been explored extensively. The medial temporal
lobe, including hippocampal dentate gyrus (DG), is thought to be
involved in mediating aspects of psychosis and memory deficits in
schizophrenia (3, 4). Impaired glutamatergic transmission in DG
causes deficits in spatial coding, learning, and memory and emotion
processing (5–7). However, detailed molecular mechanisms of DG
dysfunction in schizophrenia remain unclear.
Identification of risk genes in recent genetic studies has contributed to a better understanding of pathophysiological mechanisms of schizophrenia. Transmembrane protein 108 (TMEM108)
has recently been linked with schizophrenia and alcoholism in
genome-wide association studies (8, 9). In human, TMEM108 is
located on chromosome 3q21-q22, a risk locus for bipolar disorder, schizophrenia and other psychosis (10, 11). In particular, an
intronic single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) (rs7624858) is
associated with schizophrenia (8). These findings raise an important question regarding the physiological function of TMEM108
and whether abnormal expression levels of TMEM108 impair
neural development or function.
Tmem108 is a transmembrane protein, initially identified as a
protein (retrolinkin) that interacts with a neuronal isoform of
bullous pemphigoid antigen 1 (BPAG1n4) and promotes retrograde axonal transport in dorsal root ganglia neurons (12).
Tmem108 is also present in dendrites of hippocampal neurons
and has been implicated in BDNF-induced TrkB endocytosis and
dendrite outgrowth in cultured neurons (13, 14). However, genetic evidence is lacking regarding the in vivo function of
Tmem108 and whether its mutation impairs neural development
and causes schizophrenia-relevant behavioral deficits.
Here we show that Tmem108 was highly enriched in DG
granule neurons and that its expression is regulated by neural
development. Knocking down Tmem108 impaired spine development in cultured DG granule cells; in agreement, Tmem108
mutant (MT) mice displayed fewer and smaller spines. Both
the frequency and amplitude of excitatory postsynaptic currents
(EPSCs) of DG granule neurons were reduced in Tmem108 MT
mice. Further molecular studies suggest that Tmem108 is required for maintaining synaptic AMPA receptors on DG granule
neurons. Consequently, deletion of Tmem108 impaired spatial
recognition memory, contextual fear memory, as well as sensorimotor function. Together, these observations indicate that
Tmem108 is necessary for proper development of DG neuron
circuitry and its deletion leads to hypofunction of the glutamatergic
activity in the brain and behavioral deficits. Considering that
Tmem108 is a susceptibility gene of schizophrenia, our study sheds
light on potential pathophysiological mechanisms of this disorder.
Significance
Dentate gyrus (DG) dysfunction has been implicated in schizophrenia, a disabling psychiatric disorder. However, underlying
pathophysiological mechanisms are not clear. We provide evidence that Tmem108, a novel schizophrenia-associated gene, is
highly enriched in DG granule neurons. Tmem108 is required for
spine development and glutamatergic transmission. Further investigations indicate a critical role of Tmem108 for AMPA receptor expression in postsynaptic compartments. Mutation of
Tmem108 leads to schizophrenia-related behavioral deficits.
These results provide insight into a potential pathophysiological
mechanism for DG dysfunction in schizophrenia.

Results
Enriched Expression of Tmem108 in the DG. Tmem108 is expressed
in the nervous system and barely detectable in peripheral tissues
(12) (Fig. S1A). In the brain, Tmem108 was enriched in DG of the
hippocampus, compared with other brain regions (Fig. 1A). In
agreement, quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR) indicated that
Tmem108 mRNA was highly expressed in the DG, relative to
other hippocampal subfields and extrahippocampal regions (Fig. 1B).
To further study the regional expression, we generated Tmem108
mutant reporter mice because the available antibodies function
poorly for immunohistochemical staining (15, 16). In this strain, the
lacZ-containing cassette was inserted in the first coding exon (exon 3)
(Fig. S1B). Under the control of the endogenous promoter, betagalactosidase (β-gal) activity was expected to faithfully indicate where
Tmem108 is expressed. To avoid possible effect of Tmem108 mutation on brain structures, β-gal assay was performed using samples
from heterozygous mice. As shown in Fig. 1C, β-gal activity was highly
enriched in both suprapyramidal and infrapyramidal blades of the
DG, areas where granule neurons locate. Little β-gal activity was
detected in layers of CA1 or CA3 regions where pyramidal neurons
are enriched, suggesting that Tmem108 was rather specifically
expressed in DG granule neurons. β-Gal activity was detectable at a
much lower level in the cortical region, mostly in layers 2/3. Together,
these results suggest that Tmem108 is highly enriched in the DG of
the hippocampus.
Tmem108 expression in the hippocampus was developmentally
regulated. As shown in Fig. 1 D and E, β-gal activity as well as
Tmem108 protein was undetectable in the DG at postnatal day 1
(P1) and became detectable at P7, although at a low level. The
levels seemed to peak between P15 and P21 and remained at a high
level at adult age. The enrichment of β-gal activity in suprapyramidal
and infrapyramidal blades suggests that Tmem108 is expressed in
granule cells. To test this hypothesis, we costained β-gal with different cell markers. As shown in Fig. 1F, β-gal colocalized with
prospero homeobox protein 1 (Prox1), a marker of granule neurons
(17), but not with polysialylated neuronal cell adhesion molecule
(PSA-NCAM), a marker of neuronal precursors (18). Finally, we
determined subcellular localization of Tmem108 and found that
Tmem108 is enriched in the postsynaptic dense (PSD) fraction, but
not presynaptic fraction (Fig. 1G). These results demonstrate that
Tmem108 is specifically expressed in DG neurons and enriched in
the PSD and that its expression temporally correlates with a period
critical for spine development.
Spine Abnormality of Tmem108-Deficient DG Granule Neurons. To
determine whether Tmem108 regulates spine formation, we investigated the effects of changing Tmem108 levels. Neurons were
isolated from P0 pups, transfected at DIV13, and fixed at DIV20
for spine analysis. Neurons were stained with anti-Prox1 antibody,
which helped to identify DG granule neurons (17) (Fig. S2A). As
shown in Fig. 2 A and B, spine number was increased in DG
neurons that were transfected with Flag-Tmem108, suggesting that
higher levels of Tmem108 promotes spine formation. On the other
hand, neurons transfected with Tmem108 shRNA, which was able
to reduce Tmem108 expression (Fig. S2B), formed fewer spines,
which was associated with reduced spine width and increased
spine length (Fig. 2 A and B). These effects were specific as they
were not observed in neurons transfected with scrambled shRNA,
and it could be diminished by cotransfecting a shRNA-resistant
Tmem108 (Fig. S2B and Fig. 2A). These results indicate an important role of Tmem108 in spine development.
To determine whether Tmem108 deficiency alters spine development in vivo, we characterized Tmem108 MT mice. As
shown in Fig. S1 B and C, the insertion of the lacZ-Neo cassette
introduces a stop codon with a polyadenylation termination
signal (15, 16), which would terminate or severely reduce transcription of the Tmem108 gene. In agreement, mRNA and
protein of Tmem108 were dramatically reduced in homozygous
mice (Fig. S1 D and E). Homozygous Tmem108-lacZ mice were
viable and showed no difference in body weight, compared with
wild-type littermates. Unless otherwise specified, WT and MT
indicate, respectively, wild-type and homozygous mutant littermates in the study (Fig. S1F).
Tmem108 mutation seemed to have no detectable effect on
global anatomic structures of the brain (Fig. S3A). The hippocampal organization and number of granule neurons in DG were
comparable between WT and MT mice (Fig. S3 B and C). Previous studies suggest that Tmem108 regulates dendritic outgrowth of hippocampal neurons (13, 14). As shown in Fig. S4,
dendrite length and complexity of DG granule cells, revealed by
Golgi staining, were similar between WT and MT mice (Fig. S4).
Next, we quantified dendritic spines of DG granule neurons (Fig.
2C). The spine density in the molecular layer of MT mice was
significantly reduced, which was associated with decreased spine
width and increased spine length (Fig. 2D), consistent with the
results of in vitro knockdown experiments (Fig. 2 A and B). To
determine that the spine abnormality was due to loss of
Tmem108, we used in vivo electroporation to specifically express
Tmem108 in DG neurons in MT mice (Fig. 2E). As shown in
Fig. 2 F–H, Tmem108 reintroduction was able to diminish spine
morphological deficits observed in Tmem108 MT mice.
Abnormal Excitatory Transmission in Tmem108 MT DG Granule Neurons.
Next, we examined synaptic transmission of DG granule neurons by
characterizing spontaneous excitatory postsynaptic and inhibitory

postsynaptic currents (sEPSCs and sIPSCs, respectively). sEPSCs
and sIPSCs were recorded in same cells by alternately clamping at
reversal potentials of GABAA receptor-mediated (−70 mV) and
glutamate receptor-mediated (0 mV) currents, respectively (19, 20)
(Fig. 3A). The total excitatory charge transfer was decreased in MT
mice compared with WT mice (Fig. 3B). However, the inhibitory
synaptic charge was comparable (Fig. 3C). Consequently, the sEPSC/
sIPSC ratio was decreased by almost 50% (Fig. 3D). To determine
whether Tmem108 mutation altered evoked postsynaptic currents,
we stimulated medial perforant pathway (MPP) with stimuli at
gradually increasing intensity. As shown in Fig. 3 E–G, amplitudes of
eEPSCs, but not eIPSCs, were reduced. These results suggest that
the excitatory/inhibitory (E/I) balance was disrupted by Tmem108
mutation, mostly due to impaired excitatory synaptic activity.
To further dissect how excitatory strength was suppressed in
Tmem108 MT mice, we recorded miniature EPSCs (mEPSCs) in
DG granule neurons (Fig. 3H). Both the frequency and amplitude
were significantly decreased in MT hippocampal slices (Fig. 3 I
and J). However, no difference was found in mIPSC frequency
or amplitude (Fig. S5). Together with sEPSC and sIPSC data
(Fig. 3 A–C), these results indicate compromised glutamatergic
transmission. To investigate whether glutamate release was impaired, we examined paired-pulse ratios of evoked EPSCs (Fig.
3K). As shown in Fig. 3L, paired-pulse ratios in DG granule
neurons were similar between WT and MT mice, indicating that
Tmem108 deficiency has little effect on glutamate release, suggesting a postsynaptic deficit in MT mice.
Together with morphological findings (Fig. 2), these electrophysiological results suggest that Tmem108 is necessary for
synapse development and that glutamatergic hypofunction is due
to a postsynaptic mechanism.
Decreased AMPA Receptor Surface Level of Tmem108-Deficient DG
Granule Neurons. Reduced spine number and EPSC could suggest
reduced AMPA receptor levels in DG neurons. Unexpectedly,
similar levels of AMPA receptors (GluA1 and GluA2) and NMDA
receptors (GluN1, GluN2A, and GluN2B) were detected between
control WT and Tmem108 MT tissue homogenates, suggesting
Tmem108 mutation did not alter total amounts of these proteins in
the hippocampus. Considering that Tmem108 is enriched in the
PSD (Fig. 1G), we next tested whether AMPA receptors in the
PSD were reduced. In fractions that are labeled by PSD95, but not
synaptotagmin (Fig. 1G), GluA1 and GluA2 were reduced by 13%

and 25%, respectively (Fig. 4A). Similar reductions were obtained
by concentration-dependent Western blot analysis (Fig. S6). The
reduction of AMAP receptors was specific because levels of
NMDA receptors were similar between WT and MT PSD fractions
(Fig. 4 A and B). These results suggest that Tmem108 is necessary
for proper expression of AMPA receptors at excitatory synapses.
To test this hypothesis, we characterized GluA2 surface expression in cultured granule neurons. First, we determined whether
Tmem108 was present in excitatory synapses of hippocampal granule cells. Due to lack of anti-Tmem108 antibody for staining, we
cotransfected hippocampal neurons with Flag-Tmem108 and GFPGluA2. As shown in Fig. 4C, Flag-Tmem108 staining appeared as
puncta in neurons. Tmem108 puncta colabeled with GFP-GluA2 in
spines (arrow, Fig. 4C) as well as dendrites (triangle, Fig. 4C). These
results indicate that Tmem108 is present at excitatory synapses, in
agreement with subcellular fraction data.
Next, we stained neurons for endogenous GluA2 under permeabilizing and nonpermeabilizing conditions to assess total
and surface AMPA receptors, respectively (21) (Fig. 4 D and E).
Granule neurons were identified by Prox1 antibody. GluA2
staining was similar between permeabilized WT and MT granule
neurons (Fig. 4D), indicating little change in total GluA2 level, in
agreement with Western blot data (Fig. 4A). However, GluA2
staining was reduced in nonpermeabilized MT granule neurons,
compared with that of WT (Fig. 4E). Quantitatively, reduction was
observed in the number of GluA2 puncta, the puncta area, and
soma GluA2 intensity (Fig. 4F), suggesting that Tmem108 may
regulate GluA2 trafficking. To test this hypothesis in the same
neurons, we transfected GFP-GluA2 in granule cells. Surface
GluA2 in live neurons was first labeled with chicken anti-GFP
antibody (visualized by donkey anti-chicken antibody, red). Neurons were then fixed and stained with mouse anti-GFP antibody
(visualized by goat anti-mouse antibody, green). As shown in
Fig. S7 A and B, the GluA2 surface/total ratio was reduced in
Tmem108 MT granule neurons, compared with WT neurons.
These observations are in agreement with reduced eEPSC and
mEPSC amplitudes in MT granule neurons. Together, these results suggest that Tmem108 promotes GluA2 surface expression,
without changing total levels, and thus maintains spine morphology. This notion is supported by the observations that spine
morphological deficits in Tmem108 MT DG neurons could be
rescued by overexpressing GluA2 (Fig. 4 G and H). Notice that
the effect of Tmem108 mutation was specific to Prox1-positive
neurons (i.e., granule cells) and not to Prox1-negative neurons
(presumably hippocampal pyramidal neurons) (Fig. S7 C–E).
Behavioral Deficits in Tmem108 MT Mice. Abnormal locomotor activity is thought to correspond to psychomotor agitation of schizophrenic patients (22, 23). We examined MT mice in the open field
test (Fig. 5A). Tmem108 MT mice traveled similar distances,

compared with control WT mice within 30 min of test (Fig. 5 B
and C), indicating no change in locomotor activity. Prepulse inhibition (PPI) is a test of sensory-motor gating that is often decreased in schizophrenic patients (24, 25). We used a combination
of an auditory-evoked startle stimulus (120 dB) and three levels of
prepulse stimuli (70, 75, and 80 dB) to measure PPI of MT mice
(Fig. 5D). The baseline startle responses of WT and MT mice were
similar (Fig. 5E), suggesting normal hearing and acoustic startle
reflex. However, the level of PPI was substantially lower in MT
mice than in WT mice (Fig. 5F). These results implicate that the
Tmem108 MT mice were impaired in sensorimotor gating.
Patients with schizophrenia have a wide range of cognitive
function deficits, including impairment in learning and memory,
executive function, and intelligence (26, 27). We tested spatial
recognition memory of MT mice by using the Y maze (Fig. 5G).
Tmem108 MT mice exhibited comparable number of arm entries
(Fig. 5H), in agreement with no change in locomotor activity.
However, the numbers of spontaneous alterations were significantly decreased in MT mice, compared with WT mice (Fig. 5I).
These results suggest that Tmem108 deletion impaired spatial recognition memory. To further characterize the effects of Tmem108
mutation on cognitive function, MT mice were subjected to contextual fear conditioning (Fig. 5J), a classical behavioral paradigm to
test associative memory formation and consolidation. MT mice displayed similar freezing response to footshocks during training (Fig.
5K), compared with WT mice, suggesting comparable ability in fear
acquisition. However, the freezing time of MT mice in the absence of
footshocks when reintroduced to the same cage 24 h later was significantly less than that of WT mice. This result suggests that deletion of Tmem108 suppressed fear memory consolidation (Fig. 5K).
These results indicate that Tmem108 is required for proper cognitive
function. Together, these observations indicate that Tmem108 mutation specifically impairs PPI and cognitive function without altering
locomotor activity.
Discussion
In this paper, we provide evidence that Tmem108 was enriched
in DG granule neurons and its expression increased at postnatal days, a period critical for neural development. Tmem108
knockdown in cultured neurons and mutation in mice reduced
spine number of DG granule neurons, and this effect could be
rescued by reintroduction of Tmem108. Concomitantly, mEPSC
frequency and amplitude as well as evoked EPSCs in DG granule
neurons were reduced. These results indicate hypofunction of
the glutamatergic entorhino–hippocampal pathway when Tmem108
is deficient. Cell biological studies indicate that Tmem108 is necessary for surface expression of AMPA receptors. Behaviorally,
MT mice exhibit impaired sensorimotor gating and cognitive
function. Together, these observations indicate that Tmem108
plays a critical role in regulating spine development and excitatory transmission in DG granule neurons. When Tmem108
is mutated, mice displayed E/I imbalance and behavioral deficits relevant to schizophrenia, revealing potential pathophysiological mechanisms of schizophrenia.
DG is a critical region for higher brain functions, including
spatial coding, learning memory, and emotion processing (5, 6).
Hypofunctional glutamatergic signaling in the DG has been observed in patients with schizophrenia (3, 4). However, underlying
pathophysiological mechanisms are less clear. During the first
2 wk after birth in mice, precursor granule cells migrate from the
hilus to the granule cell layer of the DG, where they form synapses
with other neurons (28, 29). Tmem108 expression in DG begins to
increase at P7 and plateaus between P21 and P30. This unique
temporal expression correlates with active synaptic pruning in the
hippocampus (30, 31), suggesting a role of Tmem108 after the
migration of granule precursor cells. In support of this hypothesis,
in Tmem108 MT mice, the number of NeuN+ cells in the DG and
dendritic arborization of granule cells were not changed. In contrast, dendritic spine density and size of DG granule neurons were
reduced, and spine length was increased in Tmem108 MT mice,
indicating that Tmem108 is necessary for spine formation and
maturation. Ensuing hypofunction of the glutamatergic transmission leads to behavioral deficits associated with schizophrenia.
AMPA receptors within the postsynaptic domain are critical for
maintaining and strengthening spine structure and function (32–
34). Knockout of GluA2, a subunit of AMPA receptor, causes
spine deficits in DG granule cells (33). Tmem108 deficiency reduced AMPA receptor surface level of DG neurons without
changing the total level. There was a concomitant reduction of
AMPA receptors in the PSD fraction. This effect is specific because Tmem108 mutation had no effect on total or surface levels
of NMDA receptors of DG neurons. Importantly, spine deficits in
Tmem108 MT DG neurons could be rescued by overexpressing
GluA2. A parsimonious interpretation of these results is that
Tmem108 promotes surface expression of AMPA receptors that is
necessary for spine development. AMPA receptor dynamics in
spines are regulated by proteins that control the cytoskeleton. For
example, the stabilization of postsynaptic AMPA receptors as well as
spine morphology are regulated by small G proteins of the Rho
family (35, 36). Rac and Cdc42 regulate spine stabilization by activating the Arp2/3 complex to promote actin nucleation and inhibit

actin depolymerization (37, 38). A recent study identified Tmem108
as a binding partner of cytoplasmic FMRP-interacting protein 1/2
(CYFIP1/2) to regulate Arp2/3 by promoting the formation of the
wave regulator complex (14). The CYFIP1 gene is located in
the 15q11.2 region of the human genome, which is implicated in the
development of neurological and neuropsychiatric conditions such
as autism spectrum disorder, epilepsy, intellectual disability, and
schizophrenia (39–41). Its copy number variation is linked to both
schizophrenia and autism spectrum disorder (40, 42). Down-regulating
CYFIP1 levels increases the ratio of immature-to-mature spines
and the mobility of surface AMPA receptors (41). Taken together, these observations could suggest that Tmem108 may regulate spines of DG granule neurons via interacting with CYFIP1/2.
Exact mechanisms by which Tmem108 regulates spines and synaptic
expression of AMPA receptors warrant further investigation.
The SNP (rs7624858) that associates with schizophrenia is located between the first coding exon (exon 3) and exon 4. Being
intronic, this SNP may interfere with the expression of the
Tmem108 gene, although there are no data at the present that this
SPN predicts a higher or lower level of mRNA or protein. We
found that elevating the level of Tmem108 increased the number
of spines in DG granule neurons in culture, whereas reducing
its level diminishes the spines in cultured neurons as well as in
Tmem108 MT mice. These observations suggest that a proper
level of Tmem108 needs to be maintained for homeostasis of
spines. Altered level, either high or low, could serve as a pathophysiological mechanism (43).
