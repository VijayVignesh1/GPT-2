Fragile X syndrome (FXS) results from the loss of the fragile X mental retardation protein (FMRP), an RNA-binding protein that
regulates a variety of cytoplasmic mRNAs. FMRP regulates mRNA translation and may be important in mRNA localization to
dendrites. We report a third cytoplasmic regulatory function for FMRP: control of mRNA stability. In mice, we found that FMRP
binds, in vivo, the mRNA encoding PSD-95, a key molecule that regulates neuronal synaptic signaling and learning. This
interaction occurs through the 3¢ untranslated region of the PSD-95 (also known as Dlg4) mRNA, increasing message stability.
Moreover, stabilization is further increased by mGluR activation. Although we also found that the PSD-95 mRNA is synaptically
localized in vivo, localization occurs independently of FMRP. Through our functional analysis of this FMRP target we provide
evidence that dysregulation of mRNA stability may contribute to the cognitive impairments in individuals with FXS.

FXS is caused by a trinucleotide expansion in the X-linked fragile X
mental retardation gene (FMR1) that leads to the subsequent loss of
FMRP, and it is the most common cause of X-linked mental retardation. FMRP has multiple RNA-binding motifs and is thought to be
involved in mRNA localization and translational regulation in neurons,
two processes required for synaptic plasticity (reviewed in ref. 1).
Because the only obvious abnormality in the brains of individuals with
FXS is the presence of longer, immature-appearing spines1, current
models have focused on the possible dysregulation of synaptic mRNAs
as an underlying cause of FXS mental deficits.
A wide variety of mRNAs have been identified as potential targets of
mammalian FMRP, both in vitro and in vivo2,3. FMRP binds various
mRNA elements1, including a G-rich RNA structure (G-quartet)4–6
and U-rich stretches7. FMRP is also indirectly recruited to some
target mRNAs via binding to the noncoding RNAs BC1 and BC200
(refs. 8–11). Finally, both mammalian and Drosophila FMRP are
present in microRNA (miRNA) complexes12 and may be recruited to
mRNAs that are bound to miRNAs.
In the FMRP protein, the RGG box recognizes G-quartet sequences
present in some FMRP targets4, whereas the N-terminus recognizes a
bulge in BC RNAs10. Notably, although FMRP contains two KH
domains, a known RNA-binding motif, no endogenous neuronal
targets that are recognized by this domain have been identified13.
Functionally, FMRP acts as a translational repressor of a subset of
neuronal mRNAs3, and it may be involved in synaptic mRNA
localization, as FMRP is present in mRNP localization complexes14.

A limited number of studies also suggest that FMRP may
regulate transcription15–17.
Despite much research, it remains unclear precisely how the loss of
FMRP leads to alterations in the neuronal mechanisms responsible for
cognition. One proposal suggests that alterations in metabotropic
glutamate receptor (mGluR)-mediated signaling might underlie a
number of the cognitive deficits associated with FXS18. Disruption of
NMDA receptors19 or associated signaling components20–22 can also
lead to impairments in synaptic plasticity. Notably, mGluRs and
NMDA receptors coexist in a large-scale signaling complex23. PSD-95
(DLG4), a component of the MAGUK family of adaptor proteins that
includes SAP102 (DLG3) and PSD-93, binds directly to the NMDA
receptor and links other adaptors to mGluRs24. Mice lacking PSD-95
have impairments in learning20 and cortical plasticity21. Similarly,
SAP102 mutant mice show learning impairments25, and mutations
in human SAP102 are implicated in mental retardation26. Notably,
PSD-95 mutant mice also show dendritic spine abnormalities in the
striatum and hippocampus27, one of the key alterations seen in humans
with FXS and in FMRP mutant mice1. A quantitative neuroimaging
study also found larger right and left hippocampal volumes in
individuals with FXS compared with controls, suggesting that this
region may be involved in the behavioral and cognitive abnormalities
associated with FXS28.
One report has indicated that FMRP regulates PSD-95 protein levels
in response to mGluR signaling29. However, putative FMRP-binding
sites were identified by sequence analysis, and direct interactions

Figure 1 FMRP interacts directly with the 3¢ UTR of PSD-95 mRNA. (a) Brain lysates from wild-type (WT) and FMR1 knockout mice (KO) were
immunoprecipitated with FMRP antibodies. RT-PCR was performed using oligonucleotides specific for the PSD-95, MAP1B and GluR1 mRNAs. Input (1/5)
is reported in lane 2. Lanes that were not relevant to this experiment were removed between the marker and lanes 1 and 2. (b) CLIP assay. Hippocampal cell
extracts were immunoprecipitated with FMRP antibodies. RT-PCR was performed using oligonucleotides for the PSD-95, MAP1B and GlyRa mRNAs. Input

fragments (1–5) of the PSD-95 3¢ UTR were incubated in the presence of FMRP (+, lanes 2, 4, 6, 8 and 10). Control reactions were performed in buffer alone

are indicated.

between the PSD-95 mRNA and FMRP were not tested. Although the
authors concluded that these effects were due to translational regulation of PSD-95 mRNA, the above mentioned results could not formally
distinguish between effects on mRNA export, stability or translation.
In this study we provide a detailed assessment of the role that
FMRP has in controlling PSD-95 expression. We have found that
FMRP interacts directly with the 3¢ UTR of the PSD-95 mRNA,
providing evidence that FMRP is important in increasing the stability
of the PSD-95 message. This stabilization is further increased by mGluR
activation. These findings suggest that, in addition to dysregulation of
translation targets, some of the FXS impairments may arise as a result
of alterations in the stability of FMRP target mRNAs.
RESULTS
PSD-95 mRNA interacts directly with FMRP
To address whether FMRP directly regulates PSD-95 mRNA, we
examined whether PSD-95 mRNA was present in the FMRP complex
in mice. We found PSD-95 mRNA in FMRP immunoprecipitates from
wild-type mice but not from FMR1 knockout mice (Fig. 1a). A known
FMRP-interacting mRNA, MAP1B (refs. 8,30,31), was also coprecipitated (Fig. 1a), whereas a negative control mRNA (GluR1, also known
as Gria1) was not (Fig. 1a). Using reversible cross-linking–immunoprecipitation (CLIP)32 from primary hippocampal neurons (Fig. 1b),
we showed that FMRP bound directly to the PSD-95 mRNA, as crosslinking occurred only if FMRP and PSD-95 were in close proximity in
vivo. MAP1B mRNA, but not GlyRa (also called Glra1) mRNA, was also
cross-linked to FMRP (Fig. 1b).These data indicate that PSD-95
mRNA is part of the FMRP mRNP complex in vivo.
To map the FMRP–PSD-95 mRNA interaction, we carried out direct
protein-RNA binding assays. We focused on the 3¢ untranslated region
(UTR) of PSD-95 mRNA because in silico analysis of this region had
shown the presence of a putative G-quartet29 and three U-rich

stretches33 (Fig. 1c and Supplementary Fig. 1 online), sequence
elements previously shown to recruit FMRP to RNAs4,7. Of the five
short RNAs that spanned the entire 3¢ UTR of the mouse PSD-95
mRNA (Fig. 1c), only fragment 5 had FMRP-binding ability in
electrophoretic mobility shift assays (EMSAs) with purified baculovirus-expressed human FMRP protein (Fig. 1d). This RNA fragment
was also bound by mouse brain extracts (data not shown). The lack of
FMRP binding to fragments 1–4 (Fig. 1d) and the antisense strand
(data not shown), and the ability of excess unlabeled fragment 5 RNA
to compete, indicated that the FMRP-RNA interaction was specific and
did not simply reflect general RNA affinity. The protein-binding ability
of fragment 5 RNA was also specific, as it did not bind other RNA
binding proteins (the microbial transcription and translation
modulator NusG or the spliceosomal 15.5-kDa (hSnu13p) protein;
data not shown).
We also investigated which protein domain of FMRP (N-terminus,
KH1, KH2 or C-terminus)34 was involved in binding to the PSD-95
mRNA (Fig. 2a). We found that only the C-terminus contained PSD-95
mRNA–binding ability (Fig. 2b). This domain bound with high
affinity, as binding remained present under high-stringency conditions
(50 mM LiCl) (Fig. 2c). The binding was specific, as the C-terminus
did not interact with fragment 1, and binding to fragment 5
was competed with by excess unlabeled fragment 5, but not
fragment 1 (Fig. 2c).
We further mapped the mRNA region in fragment 5 that was
responsible for FMRP binding by scrambling the G-rich region to
eliminate all similarity to the G-quartet consensus and converting
the U-rich regions into mixed sequences (Fig. 3a). High lithium
(50 mM), a condition that destabilizes G-quartet structures4,35, did
not interfere with FMRP binding to either the wild-type (Fig. 3b)
or the mutagenized fragment 5 (Fig. 3b). Notably, mutagenesis of
all three U-rich regions did not prevent FMRP binding (Fig. 3b).

Because previous studies suggested that FMRP has a high affinity
for poly(rG) in vitro34, we further examined the G-rich region.
Although the entire G-rich region showed binding to FMRP
(Figs. 3c,d; I + II G-rich), even in the presence of high lithium salt
(Fig. 3d), no binding was detected when we used two short RNA
fragments (Figs. 3c,d) of that region (Fig. 3c). Our findings argue that
FMRP recognizes a structured G-rich sequence in the 3¢ UTR of the
PSD-95 mRNA or a region spanning the two fragments, and that this
structure does not form a G-quartet.
Similar PSD-95 polysomal profile in wild type and knockout
FMRP can act as a translational repressor3,31 and local translation of
synaptic mRNAs has been increasingly implicated in neuronal plasticity, learning and memory formation (reviewed in ref. 36). Notably, a
number of localized mRNAs encode synaptic proteins (for example,
Arc, MAP1B, aCaMKII and SAPAP4) that are translationally repressed
by FMRP8,16. Thus far, our experiments indicate that FMRP can
directly interact with the PSD-95 mRNA, but do not address the
functional role of this interaction.
We assessed whether PSD-95 mRNA translation was regulated by
FMRP, as was previously proposed29, by carrying out sucrose gradient
fractionation of cytoplasmic (Fig. 4a) and hippocampal (Fig. 4b) brain
extracts from wild-type and FMR1 knockout mice. Unexpectedly, the
percentage of PSD-95 mRNA associated with polysomes did not
change in the FMR1 knockout animals compared with wild-type
animals in either whole brain or hippocampal extracts. Although the
profile of the negative control, b-actin (ACTB) mRNA, also remained
unchanged, Arc mRNA, which is known to be translationally regulated
by FMRP8, showed the expected shift toward a more translationally
active polysome pool in FMR1 knockout extracts. We cannot formally
rule out the possibility that FMRP changes the translation efficiency of
the PSD-95 mRNA without changing the percentage messenger on
polysomes (PMP) ratio (for example, by altering miRNA-regulated
translation; reviewed in ref. 37). However, because other FMRPregulated mRNAs (such as Arc) do change their PMP ratio, the
above findings indicate that FMRP does not regulate PSD-95
protein synthesis in a manner similar to those of other well-studied
FMRP targets.

PSD-95 mRNA is dendritically localized with FMRP in vivo
It has been estimated that hundreds of mRNAs are present in dendrites,
but whether the entire population or only a subset are localized near
synapses is currently unknown38. Because this list includes mRNAs that
are known targets of FMRP (for example, Arc, aCaMKII), and because
PSD-95 is an integral component of the postsynaptic density, we
assessed whether the PSD-95 message was localized in dendrites and,
if so, whether this localization was dependent on FMRP.
By analyzing the presence of PSD-95 mRNA in synaptoneurosomes
from total brain, we found that PSD-95 mRNA showed a marked
dendrite/soma enrichment ratio (Supplementary Fig. 2 online), suggesting that the mRNA was localized at synapses. This was further
confirmed by in situ hybridization in neuronal cultures (Fig. 5). We
found that PSD-95 mRNA localized in both cell bodies and along
dendrites of hippocampal (Fig. 5a) and cortical (data not shown)
neurons with a typical punctate pattern. Similarly, a recent large-scale
screen also suggested putative targeting of the PSD-95 mRNA to both
proximal and distal dendrites39. Unexpectedly, although PSD-95
mRNA largely colocalized with FMRP throughout the cell and into
neurites (Fig. 5a), the PSD-95 mRNA was still localized in dendrites
from FMR1 knockout hippocampal (Fig. 5a) and cortical (data not
shown) cultures. Control experiments indicated that we could specifically detect dendritic (aCaMKII) and cell body (a-tubulin) mRNAs38
(Fig. 5b), and that the sense probes did not show any specific mRNA
staining (Supplementary Fig. 3 online). These data further confirm
that the PSD-95 message is part of an FMRP mRNP complex,
but suggest that FMRP function is not necessary to localize the
PSD-95 message.
We confirmed that PSD-95 mRNA was dendritically localized using
both digoxigenin (DIG) RNA labeling (data not shown) and radioactive in situ hybridization (Fig. 6) on brain slices. PSD-95 mRNA was
present in the hippocampus, cortex (Fig. 6a) and cerebellum (Fig. 6b).
The unlocalized control mRNA (a-tubulin) stained only cell bodies in
the hippocampus and dentate gyrus (Fig. 6c and Supplementary Fig. 4
online). Although PSD-95 mRNA localization was distinct from
another localized mRNA (aCaMKII; Fig. 6d and Supplementary
Fig. 4), PSD-95 mRNA was clearly present in hippocampal dendrites
of both wild-type and FMR1 knockout mice in a region corresponding

However, as PSD-95 mRNA is clearly present in dendrites in the
absence of FMRP (Figs. 5a and 6a), our data suggest that the FMRP
does not have a primary role in PSD-95 mRNA localization.
Impaired PSD-95 mRNA and protein levels in FMR1 knockout
Our results suggest that FMRP does not directly regulate translation
(Fig. 4) or transport (Figs. 5 and 6) of PSD-95 mRNA. Earlier reports,

however, have suggested that FMRP might also control mRNA abundance via transcriptional regulation15–17. Notably, our radioactive
in situ hybridization data indicated a possible decrease in PSD-95
mRNA intensity in hippocampal neurons from FMR1 knockout
mice (Fig. 6a), suggesting that mRNA abundance may be regulated
by FMRP.
To determine whether FMRP controls mRNA abundance, we first
examined the total PSD-95 mRNA level in wild-type and FMR1
knockout mice. In total brain, PSD-95 mRNA levels were significantly
decreased in FMR1 knockouts compared with wild-type mice (Fig. 7a).
Notably, quantitative RT-PCR analyses carried out on the three
principal brain areas (hippocampus, cerebellum and cortex) showed
that the decrease in PSD-95 mRNA was very pronounced in the
hippocampus, less so in the cerebellum and not observed in the cortex
(Fig. 7b). Quantitative RT-PCR analyses of the PSD-95 mRNA from
hippocampal neurons of wild-type and FMR1 knockout mice confirmed this hippocampal-specific decrease in PSD-95 mRNA (Fig. 7c).
Although there was a subtle trend toward lower abundance of PSD-95
mRNA in the hippocampus as detected with radioactive in situ
hybridization (Fig. 6), this was not statistically significant, and we
believe that these differences may be due to different sensitivities
of the techniques. Differential PSD-95 expression was also reflected at

neurons. Notably, after transcriptional blockade with actinomycin D,
PSD-95 mRNA abundance was significantly and selectively reduced in
hippocampal cultures in the absence of FMRP (Fig. 8a and Supplementary Fig. 5 online). The stability of PSD-95 mRNA was unaffected
in FMR1 knockout cortical cultures (Supplementary Fig. 6 online), in
agreement with prior results (Fig. 6a and 7b,c). These results were not
due to nonspecific cell death effects, as the morphology of hippocampal
cells from wild-type and FMR1 knockout mice were the same (Supplementary Fig. 7 online) and cell survival was the same in both
genotypes (Fig. 8b), although we did note that after 12 h both the wildtype and FMR1 knockout neurons showed some increase in the

in the hippocampus and a nonsignificant decrease in the cerebellum
(Fig. 7d, P 4 0.05).
These data suggest that either transcription or stability of the PSD-95
mRNA is regulated by FMRP in the hippocampus. Critically, the
hippocampus is important for the learning processes that are altered
in people with FXS40, and the loss of PSD-95 results in hippocampaldependent learning defects20.

ARTICLES
amount of cell death (E25%). Together, these results suggest that
FMRP functions to stabilize the PSD-95 mRNA specifically in the
hippocampus. Furthermore, the stability of a reporter (Renilla
reniformis luciferase) RNA carrying the FMRP-interacting portion of
the PSD-95 3¢ UTR (fragment 5) was more stable when transfected into
wild-type versus FMR1 knockout hippocampal neurons (Fig. 8c),
whereas a reporter RNA containing another PSD-95 3¢ UTR that
does not bind FMRP (fragment 2) was equally unstable in both
cultures (Fig. 8c). These data strongly suggest that a direct interaction
between FMRP and the PSD-95 3¢ UTR is necessary to confer
mRNA stabilization.
Because FMRP has not been previously shown to regulate mRNA
stability, we also assessed the stability of 11 other FMRP targets and 2
synaptic scaffolding proteins whose mRNAs are localized in dendrites
(Homer1a and Shank1). Of these mRNAs (Supplementary Table 1
online), only myelin basic protein mRNA (MBP) changed its stability.
MBP mRNA is a target of FMRP regulation41, and is present only in glia
cells, which also express FMRP8,41. We detected the MBP mRNA
because our primary neurons were cocultured with glial cells. Notably,
although this list is clearly not exhaustive, our analyses suggest that
FMRP-mediated mRNA stabilization is a highly selective mechanism
with respect to both cell type and target mRNA, and that it works in
both neurons and glia.
Because FMRP is regulated by mGluR activation (for example, see
refs. 29,42,43), we also investigated whether mGluR stimulation would
alter FMRP-dependent PSD-95 mRNA stabilization. Using two independent protocols (see Methods for details), we found that the presence
of (S)-3,5-dihydroxyphenylglycine (DHPG) further stabilized PSD-95
mRNA in wild-type cells at both time points measured (Fig. 8d). In
FMR1 knockout cells, the addition of DHPG provided only transient
stabilization that did not persist at the later time point, suggesting that
DHPG might also have a transient, FMRP-independent effect on
mRNA half-life. Quantification of three independent experiments
indicated that there was a significant DHPG-dependent stabilization
effect only in the wild-type neurons and that this effect was mostly lost
in FMR1 knockout hippocampal cells (Fig. 8d). Together, the data
suggest that there is a long-lasting FMRP-dependent stabilization effect
via mGluR-specific neuronal activity.
DISCUSSION
In this paper we have shown that FMRP interacts directly with the
3¢ UTR of PSD-95 mRNA. However, we found that PSD-95 mRNA
polysomal association remained the same in wild-type and FMR1
knockout mice and that the PSD-95 mRNA was still dendritically
localized in FMR1 knockout neurons. Although translation of the PSD95 mRNA may decrease as a result of postinitiation mechanisms (that
is, as in the case of some miRNAs; reviewed in ref. 37) that we cannot
detect with the current assay, this translation mechanism would be
different from that previously documented for other FMRP targets
(such as Arc).
Notably, we found that the FMRP–PSD-95 mRNA interaction
resulted in a stabilization of the PSD-95 message that can be further
increased via mGluR stimulation. In FMR1 knockout mice the PSD-95
message was less stable, resulting in a reduction of this critical synaptic
protein. These observations are consistent with previous circumstantial
evidence suggesting that FMRP could potentially control mRNA
abundance. A microarray study identified 113 FMRP-associated
mRNAs whose abundances are reduced in fragile X cell lines, yet
whose polysome profile remained unchanged16. Another study found
decreases in the levels of some FMRP-target mRNAs in the absence of
FMRP17. Although neither group examined these mRNAs further, it is

584

possible that reduced levels of these mRNAs actually reflect a loss of
mRNA stability in the absence of FMRP. Our finding that at least one
other mRNA (MBP) was destabilized in the absence of FMRP lends
support to this idea.
Unexpectedly, we found that the stabilization of the PSD-95 message
was dependent on the area of the brain examined. The effect was most
prominent in the hippocampus, present to a minor extent in
cerebellum and nonexistent in the cortex. This lack of a cortical effect
is consistent with previous findings that PSD-95 protein levels are the
same in wild-type and FMR1 knockout cortical cells29. That study also
observed an FMRP-dependent increase in PSD-95 protein in cortical
cells shortly after DHPG treatment, but found that protein levels fell
back to baseline by 4 h29, suggesting that there was a transient surge in
PSD-95 expression. In hippocampal neurons, we observed that the
relative level of the PSD-95 mRNA rose slightly after 4–6 h of DHPG
exposure, suggesting that there is an additional activity-dependent
increase in RNA stability. Together, these data suggest that FMRP can
regulate, according to the physiological state (DHPG-treated or not)
and cell type (cortical or hippocampal), both a rapid rise in PSD-95
translation (cortex) and a more prolonged rise in PSD-95 mRNA levels
as a result of an increase in stability (hippocampus), and suggest that
FMRP could have multiple independent roles.
We have mapped the binding site of FMRP to a G-rich element that
is flanked by two AU-rich elements (AREs), well-known cis-acting
mRNA elements that regulate mRNA half-life. Several trans-acting
factors that aid in both stabilization and destabilization of target
mRNAs are known to bind to AREs44. Notably, regulation of HuD, a
member of the Hu class of ARE-binding proteins44, during neuronal
development results in temporal regulation of GAP-43 (ref. 45).
Similarly, regulation of mRNA stability is often the result of competition between stabilizing and destabilizing factors44. It is therefore
plausible that the region-specific regulation of the PSD-95 message is
a result of interference between the stabilizing role of FMRP and the
stabilizing and destabilizing functions of other binding factors. In
support of this notion, we found that the hippocampus and cortex
contained different forms of Hu-family proteins (Supplementary
Fig. 8 online). Combinatorial models are an emerging theme explaining RNA-protein binding specificity (reviewed in ref. 46,47), and in our
case may explain why FMRP does not stabilize all of its known binding
targets (Supplementary Table 1).
We also found that the PSD-95 mRNA was localized in dendrites in
vivo, but that its localization was not dependent on FMRP, further
highlighting the complexity surrounding FMRP’s many roles in the
cytoplasm. Several factors are known to bind to FMRP and are
presumed to aid it in these cytoplasmic regulatory functions. To
date, however, only one of these interactions has been shown to aid
FMRP function. Cooperative binding between FMRP and the BC1
RNA leads to the translational repression of a subset of mRNAs, and
BC1 functions as a repressor of translational initiation in rabbit
reticulocyte assays3. We expect further binding partners to collaborate
with FMRP to aid translational repression, mRNP localization and this
newly identified mRNA stabilization function.
Although a large number of putative FMRP target mRNAs have been
isolated in the past 5 years, relatively few are known to be involved in
regulating synapse structure and function. Our results strengthen the
idea that FMRP function is extremely important for the correct
formation of the postsynaptic compartment. These results also support
the notion that the underlying cause of FXS, and potentially other
forms of mental retardation, may involve direct interference with
synaptic signaling that leads to spine dysmorphogenesis and ultimately
to memory defects1. Notably, the mRNA encoding a PSD-95 associated

ARTICLES
protein, SAPAP4, has also been shown to be in a complex with FMRP16.
In addition, PSD-95, SAPAP4, Arc and aCaMKII are all components of
the large-scale NMDA receptor signaling complex that links NMDA
receptors to the mGluR signaling pathway23, and disruption of PSD-95
(ref. 20), Arc48 and aCaMKII (ref. 22) all result in learning impairments. This is of interest in light of the evidence suggesting that
alterations in glutamate receptor signaling via mGluRs might underlie
a number of the cognitive deficits associated with FXS23. Furthermore,
various other cases of neurological deficits also result in a decrease in
PSD-95 expression (for example, refs. 49,50), suggesting that strict
regulation of PSD-95 expression is required for proper brain function.
PSD-95 is important in both behavioral memory and dendritic spine
morphology27, both features of FXS. Together, these results suggest that
FMRP may regulate NMDA and mGluR receptor signaling through
several proteins, including PSD-95, and that the cognitive and anatomical defects in FXS may arise from the disruption of this complex.

DNA, and in vitro synthesized Cy5-labeled riboprobe). We carried out
immunofluorescence and immunohistochemistry preincubation in 2% donkey
serum, 0.2% Triton X-100, and then incubation in 1% BSA with antibodies
specific for FMRP antibodies8, followed by Cy3-labeled secondary antibodies
specific for rabbit IgG (Jackson ImmunoResearch). We analyzed neurons by
confocal scanning microscopy (Zeiss LSM 510).

METHODS

Immunoprecipitation and RT-PCR. Whole brain was homogenized in 10 mM
HEPES pH 7.4, 200 mM NaCl, 0.5% Triton X-100, 30 mM EDTA, protease
inhibitors (Sigma-Aldrich) and 30 U ml–1 RNasin. We preblocked 20 ml protein
A–Sepharose (0.1 mg ml–1 BSA, 0.1 mg ml–1 yeast tRNA and 0.1 mg ml–1
glycogen) for 1 h and then immunoprecipitated with specific FMRP antibodies8. DNase I (RNase-free, Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) was added
during washes. We treated the immunoprecipitate with 50 mg proteinase K
(Sigma-Aldrich) before RNA extraction and precipitation. First-strand synthesis was performed using p(dN)6 and 100 U of M-MLV RTase (Invitrogen).
RT-PCR was performed as described in ref. 8. Radioactive semiquantitative
RT-PCR reactions were performed in nonsaturating conditions in the presence
of 0.2 mCi[a-32P]dCTP, 1 mM dCTP and 10 mM each dATP, dGTP and dTTP
and analyzed on a 5% polyacrylamide gel.

Animal treatment. Animal care conformed to institutional guidelines in
compliance with national and international laws and policies (European
Community Council Directive 86/609, Oja L 358,1, December 12, 1987; NIH
Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals). All animals were 3-weekold males (C57/BL6 wild type and two FMR1 knockout strains on C57/BL6 and
FVB background).
Western blots. We used standard methodologies with an FMRP monoclonal
antibody (MAB2160) from Chemicon and a polyclonal antibody (rAM2)
produced in our laboratory8. The PSD-95 antibody was from Upstate
(1:1,000) and the eIF4E antibody from Cell Signaling (1:10,000). All secondary
antibodies were from Promega. The proteins were revealed using ECL Plus and
a phosphoimager (both from Amersham).
cDNA constructs. We obtained a mouse PSD-95 cDNA construct with the 3¢
UTR from the IMAGE consortium (ID 10318) and also isolated PSD-95 coding
and 3¢ UTR fragments via RT-PCR from mouse brain extract and T/A cloning
(Promega Easy T/A cloning kit; pT/A-Fragment 1–5). Details of constructs and
mutagenesis are reported in the Supplementary Methods online. FMRP
protein domains were previously reported34.
EMSA. We carried out binding reactions using full-length human FMRP
protein in binding buffer (300 mM KCl, 5 mM MgCl2, 2 mM DTT, 0.5%
glycerol, 20 mM HEPES pH 7.5 and 300 ng ml–1 tRNA), incubating at 25 1C or
4 1C for 30 min. We added heparin (0.3 mg) for 5 min before separation on a
6% native polyacrylamide gel. We carried out binding reactions with FMRP
domains in the same buffer plus 100 or 300 mM KCl and 50–100-ng
recombinant protein.
In vitro transcription. We carried out these reactions using standard protocols
(Ambion SP6/T7 Mega-Script) with [a-32P]UTP, [a-35S]UTP and UTP-Cy5 for
EMSA, northern blotting and in situ hybridization, respectively.
Primary cultures. We prepared primary cortical and hippocampal neuronal
cultures from embryonic mice (embryonic day 15, cortical; embryonic day 19,
hippocampal) using standard protocols.
Neuronal transfection. We transfected hippocampal neurons at 14 days in vitro
(DIV) using a standard Ca2+ phosphate precipitation protocol. We washed the
precipitate using Hanks’ balanced saline (HBSS) and carried out actinomycin D
experiments 48 h later.
FISH, immunofluorescence and immunohistochemistry. We fixed primary
hippocampal and cortical neurons at 20–25 1C for 15 min (4% paraformaldehyde, 2 mM MgCl2, 5 mM EGTA in 1 PBS) and then UV irradiated and
permeabilized the cells (1 PBS containing 0.1% Triton X-100). We prehybridized neurons (50% formamide, 2 SSC, 10 mM NaH2PO3) and then
hybridized at 42 1C (30% formamide, 10 mM NaH2PO3, 10% dextran sulfate,
2 SSC, 0.2% BSA, 0.5 mg ml–1 yeast tRNA and 500 mg ml–1 salmon sperm

Radioactive in situ hybridization. We cryostat sectioned, fixed (4% paraformaldehyde), permeabilized (1 mg ml–1 proteinase K) and acetylated (0.25%
of acetic anhydride in 0.1 M triethanolamine, pH 8.0) brains before
prehybridization and hybridization using standard protocols (55 1C in 50%
formamide, 1 Denhardt’s solution, 10% dextran sulfate, 0.3 M NaCl, 5 mM
EDTA, 0.5 mg ml–1 yeast tRNA, 20 mM Tris HCl pH 8.0, 50 mM DTT and 105
cpm ml–1 of [a-35S]UTP-riboprobe). Slides were emulsified (Kodak autoradiography emulsion NTB2) and developed (ILFORD PQ developer) after 7–15 d
of exposition. We analyzed sections by microscopy using a Zeiss Axioskop
(1.25 or 5 objectives), acquired images with a Canon S50 digital camera and
quantified the signal using ImageQuant and ImageJ.

Reversible cross-linking. We performed experiments as previously described32.
Briefly, we washed hippocampal neurons at 10 DIV with Neurobasal medium
containing 2% B27, and cross-linked them in 0.5% formaldehyde (J.T. Baker)
for 30 min at 20–25 1C and quenched with 0.25 M glycine (Bio-Rad). We
harvested cells by centrifugation, PBS washing and resuspension in RIPA
buffer (see ref. 32). We immunoprecipitated cross-linked complexes with
an FMRP antibody8. Before RT-PCR, we reversed cross-linking by treatment
at 70 1C.
Polysomal analysis and RT-PCR. We analyzed cytoplasmic brain extract (of
total brain and hippocampi) as previously described8. See Supplementary
Methods for details.
mRNA stability assay. We treated primary cortical or hippocampal cultures
(10 DIV) from time 0 with actinomycin D (10 mg ml–1) for the indicated times.
We washed cultures in PBS, extracted RNA with Trizol and analyzed RNA by
quantitative RT-PCR. We used a NIKON C1 with plan-neofluar 20 to analyze
both wild-type and FMR1 knockout cultures for morphology. We assessed
mRNA stability after DHPG treatment in two different ways. First, we added
DHPG (100 mM) to cultures pre-exposed to actinomycin D for 3.5 h or 5.5 h.
After 30 min of DHPG treatment, we collected mRNA for quantitative RT-PCR
analysis. Second, we added DHPG (50 mM) and actinomycin D jointly to cells
at time 0 and collected RNA 4 or 6 h later for quantitative RT-PCR analysis.
Quantitative RT-PCR. We carried out reactions with MoMLV–reverse
transcriptase (Invitrogen) and the TaqMan Universal PCR Master Mix
(ABI 4304437) using dual-labeled TaqMan probes (Applied Biosystems). We
detected mouse PSD-95 mRNA using the Pre-Developed TaqMan probe
Mm00492193_m1 and compared with the endogenous control mRNA (mouse
H3f3b mRNA Pre-Developed TaqMan probe Mm00787223_s1). Cycle parameters were as suggested by the manufacturer. Relative PSD-95 mRNA
levels, normalized to H3f3b, were calculated as follows: 2–[DeltaCt(treated) –
DeltaCt(untreated)] ¼ 2–DeltaCt, where DeltaCt equals Ct(PSD-95) – Ct(H3f3b).

Primers. We provide a table listing the primers used in this study in the
Supplementary Methods.
Neuronal cell survival (mitochondrial activity). We measured the mitochondrial activity using the colorimetric MTT assay by incubating hippocampal
cultures for 30 min at 37 1C with 1 ml of Locke’s buffer (154 mM NaCl,
5.6 mM KCl, 3.6 mM NaHCO3, 2.3 mM CaCl2, 1.2 mM MgCl2, 5.6 mM
glucose, 5 mM HEPES, pH 7.4) containing 300 mg MTT (3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyl tetrazolium, Sigma). We then dissolved cultures with
700 ml of DMSO and tested viable neurons by production of the purple MTT
cleavage product, formazan. We took three independent measurements of
sample optical density using a VICTOR 3V 1420 Multilabel Counter at 490 nm
and reported the mean with s.d. The value of each culture is divided by the
reference value (control culture at time 0).
Northern blot analysis. We probed 2 mg of poly(A)+ RNA from the entire
brain or 20 mg of total RNA using a mouse [a-32P]UTP PSD-95 mRNA
antisense probe to fragment 5 (nucleotides (nt) 2,820–3,061 of BC014807),
the entire 3¢ UTR (nt 2,227–3,061 from BC014807) or the coding region
(nt 61–2,226 of BC014807). We probed the same membrane with a b-actin
cDNA antisense fragment (nt 258–837 of X03672) and quantified radioactive
signals with a phosphoimager (Amersham).
