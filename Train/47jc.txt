Synaptic adhesion molecules regulate multiple steps of synapse formation and maturation. The great diversity of neuronal
synapses predicts the presence of a large number of adhesion molecules that control synapse formation through trans-synaptic
and heterophilic adhesion. We identified a previously unknown trans-synaptic interaction between netrin-G ligand–3 (NGL-3),
a postsynaptic density (PSD) 95–interacting postsynaptic adhesion molecule, and leukocyte common antigen-related (LAR), a
receptor protein tyrosine phosphatase. NGL-3 and LAR expressed in heterologous cells induced pre- and postsynaptic
differentiation in contacting axons and dendrites of cocultured rat hippocampal neurons, respectively. Neuronal overexpression of
NGL-3 increased presynaptic contacts on dendrites of transfected neurons. Direct aggregation of NGL-3 on dendrites induced
coclustering of excitatory postsynaptic proteins. Knockdown of NGL-3 reduced the number and function of excitatory synapses.
Competitive inhibition by soluble LAR reduced NGL-3–induced presynaptic differentiation. These results suggest that the transsynaptic adhesion between NGL-3 and LAR regulates excitatory synapse formation in a bidirectional manner.
Synaptogenesis involves a number of molecular processes, including
axon-dendrite recognition, formation of nascent synapses and
synapse maturation through recruitment of synaptic proteins. Synaptic
cell adhesion molecules have been implicated in each of these
processes1–6. Adhesion molecules capable of inducing early synaptic
differentiation include neuroligin7,8, neurexin7,9, SynCAM10,11,
NGL12,13 and EphB receptors14.
The heterophilic and trans-synaptic adhesion between postsynaptic
neuroligins and presynaptic neurexins is one of the most extensively
studied synaptic adhesions7. Neuroligin and neurexin expressed in
non-neural cells induce pre- and postsynaptic differentiation, respectively, in a bidirectional manner8,9. The interaction between neuroligin
and neurexin is regulated by alternative splicing15–17. Neuroligin
interacts with the postsynaptic scaffolding protein PSD-95 (ref. 18),
which is thought to couple synaptic adhesion to postsynaptic protein
clustering. Consistent with these important characteristics of the
neuroligin-neurexin interaction, defects in neuroligin function are
associated with human autism19,20. However, considering the great
diversity of neuronal synapses, it is probable that additional cell
adhesion molecule interactions that regulate synapse formation and
functions remain to be discovered.
Recent studies have identified the NGL family of PSD-95–interacting
postsynaptic adhesion molecules, which contains three known members, NGL-1, NGL-2 and NGL-3 (refs. 12,13). NGL associates with
netrin-G/laminet12, a family of glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI)-
anchored adhesion molecules21–23, in an isoform-specific manner;
NGL-1 and NGL-2 associate with netrin-G1 and netrin-G2, respectively12,13. In transgenic mice with netrin-G1 deficiency, NGL-1, but not
NGL-2, shows a diffuse dendritic distribution; likewise, NGL-2 is
selectively dispersed in netrin-G2–deficient mice24, suggesting that
these interactions regulate axon-dependent localization of NGL-1 and
NGL-2 in specific segments of dendrites. In support of the role for NGLs
in synapse formation, NGL-2 induces presynaptic differentiation in
contacting axons when expressed in non-neural cells13. Netrin-Gs show
extensive alternative splicing21–23, which may regulate the netrin-G–
NGL-1/2 interaction. Mice that are deficient in netrin-G2 or NGL-2
show abnormal auditory responses25. Single-nucleotide polymorphism
analysis associated both netrin-G1 and netrin-G2 with schizophrenia26.
In contrast with the increasing studies of NGL-1/2 and their ligands, the
third member of the NGL family (NGL-3), which does not bind netrinG1 or netrin-G2, has remained an orphan receptor.
LAR is well-known for its involvement in axon guidance and
presynaptic differentiation27,28. LAR contains three Ig-like domains
and eight fibronectin type III domains in the extracellular region and
two phosphatase domains in the intracellular region. The membraneproximal phosphatase domain is catalytically active, whereas the
membrane-distal phosphatase domain is inactive and associates with
various cytoplasmic proteins, including liprin-a29 and b-catenin30.
C. elegans and Drosophila homologs of LAR are involved in the
regulation of synaptic growth and active zone assembly at the neuromuscular junction (NMJ)31–33. Mammalian LAR has been shown to
regulate excitatory synaptic development and maintenance34.

Several extracellular ligands for LAR have been identified. LAR
associates with the laminin-nidogen complex, a major component
of the extracellular matrix, and regulates extracellular matrix–
dependent morphological changes in non-neural cells35. In
Drosophila, LAR associates with the heparan sulfate proteoglycans
Syndecan and Dallylike at the NMJ36,37. Syndecan is a transmembrane protein that regulates LAR-dependent presynaptic growth
and Dallylike is a GPI-anchored protein that inhibits LAR’s ability
to regulate active zone size at the NMJ36,37. LAR associates with a
small (B11 kDa) ectodomain isoform of LAR, LARFN5C, in a
homophilic manner to promote neurite outgrowth in mouse
hippocampal neurons38. However, transmembrane ligands of
LAR that adhere to LAR in a trans-synaptic manner at interneuronal synapses have not been identified in either invertebrates
or vertebrates.
Here, we identified a previously unknown interaction between
NGL-3 and LAR. NGL-3 and LAR induced pre- and postsynaptic
differentiation in contacting axons and dendrites, respectively, when
they were expressed in non-neural cells. Data from direct aggregation,
knockdown and competitive inhibition experiments suggest that the
trans-synaptic adhesion between NGL-3 and LAR regulates excitatory
synapse formation.
RESULTS
NGL-3 in HEK293 cells induces presynaptic differentiation
The synaptogenic activity of an adhesion molecule can be studied in a
mixed-culture or coculture assay in which an adhesion molecule
expressed in non-neural cells is tested for its ability to induce presynaptic differentiation in contacting axons of cocultured neurons8,39.
Accordingly, we used this mixed-culture assay to test for possible
NGL-3 synaptogenic activity. NGL-3–expressing HEK293T cells that
were cocultured with hippocampal neurons induced a strong clustering
of synapsin I, a presynaptic vesicle marker, in contacting axons, whereas
control cells expressing enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP)
alone induced minimal synapsin I clustering (Fig. 1a,b). The extent of
NGL-3–induced synapsin I clustering was much greater than that
induced by NGL-1 or NGL-2 (Fig. 1a,b). This difference was not
attributable to differential expression of the three NGL isoforms
because all three were expressed on the surface of HEK293T cells at
similar levels (Supplementary Fig. 1 online).
NGL-3–expressing HEK293T cells also induced the clustering of
both vGlut1 and VGAT, which are excitatory and inhibitory presynaptic
markers, respectively (Fig. 1c–f). NGL-3 was more efficient in inducing
vGlut1 clustering than VGAT clustering; the extent of vGlut1 clustering
relative to the EGFP control was about sixfold greater than that of

VGAT clustering (Fig. 1d,f). NGL-3 did not induce clustering of PSD95 or gephyrin, which are excitatory and inhibitory postsynaptic
markers, respectively (Supplementary Fig. 2 online), indicating that
the NGL-3–dependent presynaptic protein clustering was not induced
by interneural synapses. In contacting axons of cocultured neurons,
NGL-3 induced the uptake of antibodies that were directed against the
luminal domain of the synaptic vesicle protein synaptotagmin I, which
is present during the recycling of presynaptic vesicles (Fig. 1g,h), thus
indicating that NGL-3 induces functional presynaptic differentiation.
These results suggest that NGL-3 can induce functional presynaptic
differentiation at both excitatory and inhibitory synapses.
Expression patterns of NGL-3 proteins
Previous northern blot and in situ hybridization results have shown
that NGL-3 mRNAs are mainly expressed in the brain and are widespread in various brain regions13. The expression patterns of NGL
proteins have been studied using an antibody that recognizes all three
NGL isoforms (pan-NGL)13. To study the specific expression patterns
of NGL-3 proteins, we generated an NGL-3 antibody that does not
cross-react with NGL-1 or NGL-2 (Fig. 2a). The NGL-3 antibody
detected a single band (B115 kDa) in rat brain (Fig. 2a). The apparent
molecular weight (115 kDa) of NGL-3, which falls into the upper end
of the size range of the three NGL proteins (95–115 kDa)13, is
consistent with the longer length of NGL-3 (709 amino acids in rat)
relative to NGL-1 (640 amino acids) and NGL-2 (652 amino acids).
NGL-3 expressed in heterologous cells showed two bands (B140 and
100 kDa), which differed from the size of NGL-3 expressed in the brain.
This may reflect differential postsynaptic modification (that is,
glycosylation) because NGL-3 proteins expressed in heterologous
cells (140 and 100 kDa) showed higher and lower levels of glycosylation, respectively, compared with NGL-3 in the brain (Supplementary
Fig. 3 online).
Expression of NGL-3 proteins was gradually increased during the
first 3 weeks of postnatal rat brain development (Fig. 2b) and mainly
detected in the brain, but not in other tissues (Fig. 2c). NGL-3 was
mainly detected in synaptic fractions, including the crude synaptosomal and synaptic plasma membrane fractions (Fig. 2d). NGL-3 was
detected in PSD fractions, including the most detergent-resistant PSD
III fraction (Fig. 2e), indicative of a tight association of NGL-3 with the
PSD. PNGase F, O-glycosidase and neuramidase reduced the apparent
molecular weight of NGL-3, indicating that NGL-3 is N- and
O-glycosylated and sialylated (Fig. 2f,g).
Neuronal NGL-3 overexpression induces presynaptic contacts
We next tested the effects of NGL-3 overexpression in cultured neurons.
NGL-3 overexpression in cultured hippocampal neurons substantially
increased presynaptic contacts, as measured by the integrated intensity
of synapsin I clusters on dendrites (Fig. 3a,b). NGL-3 also induced a
strong increase in excitatory presynaptic contacts, as measured by
vGlut1 clusters (Fig. 3c,d). In contrast, inhibitory presynaptic
contacts (VGAT clusters) were not induced by NGL-3 overexpression
(Fig. 3e,f). These results suggest that NGL-3 expression in neurons
selectively induces excitatory, but not inhibitory, presynaptic differentiation in contact axons, which contrasts with our findings that both
excitatory and inhibitory presynaptic differentiation are induced by
NGL-3 in the mixed-culture experiments (Fig. 1).
However, the number of excitatory synapses, defined as vGlut1-
positive PSD-95 clusters, was reduced by NGL-3 overexpression,
mainly as the result of a decrease in the number of PSD-95 clusters
(Supplementary Fig. 4 online). It is possible that NGL-3 overexpression causes the dispersal of NGL-3–associated proteins, including PSD95, to extrasynaptic sites in a dominant-negative manner, which have
been observed in neurons overexpressing neuroligin-2 and SALM2
(refs. 9,40).
NGL-3 aggregation clusters postsynaptic proteins
Because NGL-3 has the ability to induce presynaptic differentiation, we
reasoned that it may also promote postsynaptic differentiation by
recruiting various postsynaptic proteins. To test this hypothesis, we
expressed N-terminally EGFP-tagged NGL-3 in cultured hippocampal
neurons and induced direct clustering of EGFP–NGL-3 on the dendritic surface by incubating the neurons with beads coated with
antibodies to EGFP. Direct NGL-3 aggregation induced secondary
clustering of postsynaptic proteins, including PSD-95, GKAP (a postsynaptic scaffold), Shank (a postsynaptic scaffold), GluR2 (an AMPA
receptor subunit) and NR1 (an NMDA receptor subunit), but not
gephyrin (Fig. 4). Direct aggregation of a control membrane protein
containing EGFP alone in the extracellular region (EGFP-pDis) did not

induce PSD-95 coclustering (Supplementary Fig. 5 online). A quantitative analysis showed that a large fraction of NGL-3 clusters colocalized with excitatory postsynaptic protein clusters, but not with
gephyrin clusters (95.8 ± 2.7%, n ¼ 41 for PSD-95; 0.0%, n ¼ 38 for
gephyrin; 94.6 ± 2.6%, n ¼ 45 for GKAP; 89.6 ± 5.4%, n ¼ 25 for
Shank; 83.9 ± 6.8%, n ¼ 30 for GluR2; 98.5 ± 4.5%, n ¼ 44 for NR1;
0.0%, n ¼ 33 for PSD-95 by EGFP-pDis). In addition, the fluorescent
intensities of the colocalized proteins normalized to nearby dendrites
were 2.36 ± 0.18 for PSD-95 (n ¼ 46), 0.93 ± 0.04 for gephyrin
(n ¼ 35), 2.06 ± 0.07 for GKAP (n ¼ 47), 3.26 ± 0.27 for Shank
(n ¼ 24), 1.64 ± 0.09 for GluR2 (n ¼ 44), 2.42 ± 0.10 for NR1 (n ¼ 40)
and 0.95 ± 0.99 for PSD-95 by EGFP-pDis (n ¼ 33). Postsynaptic
protein clusters induced by NGL-3 aggregation were negative for
synapsin I or synaptophysin (Fig. 4), indicating that the postsynaptic
protein clusters were not induced by interneuronal synapses. These
results suggest that NGL-3 clustering on dendrites induces excitatory,
but not inhibitory, postsynaptic differentiation.
In additional experiments, we induced dendritic NGL-3 clustering
by preclustered EGFP antibodies, instead of by EGFP antibody–
coated beads. This primary NGL-3 clustering on dendrites induced
coclustering of excitatory postsynaptic proteins (Supplementary Fig. 6 online), similar
to our results with bead-induced protein
clustering (Fig. 4). In quantitative analysis, a
large fraction of NGL-3 clusters colocalized
with excitatory postsynaptic protein clusters,
but minimally colocalized with gephyrin
clusters (Supplementary Fig. 6). In addition,
the fluorescence intensities of the colocalized excitatory postsynaptic protein clusters,
normalized to nearby dendrites, were greater
than that of gephyrin (Supplementary
Fig. 6). Collectively, these results suggest that
NGL-3 is sufficient to induce dendritic clustering of excitatory, but not inhibitory, postsynaptic proteins.
NGL-3 knockdown reduces excitatory
synapse number
We next tested whether knockdown of NGL-3
in neurons would lead to a loss of excitatory
synapses by RNA interference. We generated two independent shRNA constructs
for NGL-3 knockdown (shNGL-3 #1 and
shNGL-3 #2), which reduced NGL-3 expression in HEK293T cells by 61% and 46%,
respectively (Supplementary Fig. 7 online). In hippocampal neurons,
shNGL-3 #1 and shNGL-3 #2 also reduced the expression of exogenous
NGL-3 by 53% and 69%, respectively (Supplementary Fig. 7).
Knockdown of endogenous NGL-3 expression in cultured neurons
could not be tested because we lacked NGL-3 antibodies that are
suitable for immunostaining. In cultured hippocampal neurons,
NGL-3 knockdown by the two shNGL-3 constructs reduced the
number of excitatory synapses, defined as vGlut1-positive PSD-95
clusters, compared with control neurons transfected with empty
shRNA vector (sh-vec) (Fig. 5a,b). In contrast, NGL-3 knockdown
did not affect the number of inhibitory synapses, defined as VGATpositive gephyrin clusters (Fig. 5c,d). A variant of shNGL-3 #1 with
point mutations that do not induce NGL-3 knockdown in heterologous cells and neurons (shNGL-3 #1*; Supplementary Fig. 7) did
not reduce excitatory synapse number relative to sh-vec (Fig. 5a,b).
The reduction in excitatory synapse number by shNGL-3 #1 could be
rescued by coexpression of a NGL-3 expression construct that is
resistant to shNGL-3 #1 (NGL-3*) (Fig. 5a,b and Supplementary
Fig. 7), further supporting the specific action of shNGL-3 #1. Functionally, NGL-3 knockdown reduced the frequency, but not the

amplitude, of miniature excitatory postsynaptic currents (mEPSCs) to
a greater extent than the morphological reduction (Fig. 5e–g). These
results suggest that NGL-3 is required for the morphological and
functional maintenance of excitatory synapses.
NGL-3 interacts with LAR
NGL-3 probably induces presynaptic differentiation in contacting
axons by interacting with a presynaptic ligand. To identify a specific
ligand for NGL-3, we systematically screened NGL-3–expressing L cells
for their ability to coaggregate with a panel of L cells expressing specific
synaptic membrane proteins (examples in Supplementary Fig. 8
online). This led us to the identification of LAR as a specific ligand
for NGL-3.
In additional experiments, LAR-expressing cells selectively aggregated with NGL-3–expressing cells, but not with those expressing
NGL-1 or NGL-2 (Fig. 6a,b). Removal of extracellular calcium did
not reduce the aggregation between NGL-3– and LAR-expressing cells
(Fig. 6c,d). There was no homophilic adhesion between cells expressing
NGL-3 or LAR (Supplementary Fig. 8). To further confirm the
adhesion of NGL-3 and LAR, we incubated HEK293T cells expressing
the three NGL isoforms with LAR-ecto-Fc, a
soluble LAR protein formed by fusion of
the ectodomain of LAR with the immunoglobulin Fc domain. LAR-ecto-Fc selectively
bound to NGL-3, but not to NGL-1 or
NGL-2 (Fig. 6e). These results suggest that
LAR selectively interacts with NGL-3 in a
calcium-independent manner and that this
interaction can mediate cell adhesion.
Deletion of the leucine-rich repeat (LRR)
domain in the extracellular region of NGL-3
(NGL-3DLRR), but not the Ig domain (NGL3DIg), abolished the interaction between
NGL-3 and LAR in the cell adhesion and
soluble LAR binding assays (Supplementary
Fig. 9 online). In addition, NGL-3DLRR, but
not NGL-3DIg, failed to induce presynaptic
differentiation in contacting axons of cocultured neurons when expressed in heterologous cells (Supplementary Fig. 9). Surface
expression levels of these NGL-3 variants
were comparable, as determined by biotinylation assays (wild type, 22.0 ± 3.0; DLRR,
20.1 ± 2.6; DIg, 24.3 ± 1.5 arbitrary units).
These results indicate that the LRR domain
of NGL-3 is important for the NGL-3–LAR
interaction.
We further tested the interaction between
NGL-3 and LAR in a mixed-culture assay, in
which NGL-3–expressing HEK293T cells were
cocultured with neurons expressing exogenous LAR. NGL-3–expressing HEK293T
cells induced a strong aggregation of Flagtagged LAR (LAR-Flag) in contacting axons,
whereas EGFP-expressing HEK293T cells
(control) induced minimal LAR clustering
(average fluorescence intensities of LAR clusters normalized to the HEK293T cell area:
NGL-3 induced, 24.22 ± 5.98, n ¼ 12; EGFP
induced, 6.34 ± 0.95; n ¼ 14; P o 0.005,
Student’s t test; Fig. 6f). Conversely,
HEK293T cells expressing LAR, but not EGFP, induced clustering of
Flag-tagged NGL-3 (NGL-3–Flag) in contacting dendrites (average
fluorescence intensities of NGL-3 clusters: LAR induced, 62.27 ±
9.48, n ¼ 11; EGFP induced, 21.37 ± 2.47, n ¼ 11; P o 0.001, Student’s
t test; Fig. 6g). These results suggest that the interaction between
NGL-3 and LAR may occur in a trans-synaptic manner.
We next determined the binding affinity for the interaction between
NGL-3 and LAR. NGL-3–expressing HEK293T cells were incubated
with increasing amounts of LAR-ecto-Fc and proteins bound to the
cell surface were quantified by ELISA assays. The Kd value for the
NGL-3–LAR interaction that we calculated by Scatchard analysis was
37.4 ± 2.1 nM (Fig. 6h).
Soluble LAR inhibits NGL-3–dependent presynaptic induction
If NGL-3–induced presynaptic differentiation in the mixed-culture
assay is dependent on the interaction of NGL-3 with LAR expressed
on the surface of axons, exogenously added soluble LAR fusion
proteins (LAR-ecto-Fc), which compete with endogenous LAR for
NGL-3 binding, should inhibit the NGL-3–induced presynaptic differentiation. Indeed, LAR-ecto-Fc reduced NGL-3–induced synapsin I

clustering in contacting axons of cocultured neurons compared
with Fc alone (control) (Fig. 7a,b).
However, when we added LAR-ecto-Fc to cultured neurons, it did
not reduce the number of excitatory synapses (synapsin I–positive
PSD-95 clusters; Supplementary Fig. 10 online). It is possible that
other trans-synaptic adhesions unaffected by LAR may be maintaining
normal excitatory synapses when the LAR–NGL-3 interaction is
inhibited, whereas the synapses formed in the mixed-culture assay,
which rely on the LAR–NGL-3 interaction, but not other synaptic
adhesions, may be more easily inhibited. These results suggest that the
adhesion between NGL-3 and LAR is required for NGL-3–induced
presynaptic differentiation.
LAR in HEK293T cells induces postsynaptic differentiation
If the trans-synaptic interaction between NGL-3 and LAR is involved in
the formation of excitatory synapses, presynaptic LAR may also induce
postsynaptic differentiation in contacting dendrites. Indeed, in a
mixed-culture assay, LAR-expressing HEK293T cells induced the clustering of excitatory postsynaptic proteins PSD-95 and Shank,
whereas EGFP alone induced minimal postsynaptic protein clustering
(Fig. 8a–d). In addition, LAR expressed in HEK 293T cells did not
induce gephyrin clusters in contacting dendrites (Fig. 8e,f). These
results suggest that presynaptic LAR induces excitatory, but not
inhibitory, postsynaptic protein clustering on contacting dendrites.
LAR regulates excitatory synaptic development and maintenance
partly through its association with AMPA receptors34, suggesting that
LAR is also present on the postsynaptic plasma membrane. We therefore tested whether LAR expressed in HEK293T cells is capable of
inducing presynaptic differentiation in contacting axons. LAR-expressing HEK293T cells did not induce synapsin I clustering in contacting
axons (Fig. 8g,h). This suggests that postsynaptic LAR has a different
role, which is unrelated to the induction of presynaptic differentiation.
DISCUSSION
Here, we identified a previously unknown trans-synaptic adhesion
between NGL-3 and LAR. In support of the synaptogenic function
of this interaction, NGL-3 and LAR expressed in non-neural cells
induced pre- and postsynaptic differentiation in contacting axons and

Figure 5 Knockdown of NGL-3 leads to decreases in the number and function of excitatory synapses. (a–d) NGL-3 knockdown reduced the number of

dendrites, respectively. Neuronal NGL-3 expression increased presynaptic contacts. Dendritic NGL-3 aggregation induced excitatory
postsynaptic protein clustering. NGL-3 knockdown reduced excitatory
synapse number and function. Soluble LAR inhibited NGL-3–induced
presynaptic differentiation. These results suggest that the trans-synaptic
adhesion between NGL-3 and LAR regulates excitatory synapse formation in a bidirectional manner.
We were unable to determine the ultrastructural synaptic localization of NGL-3 because of the lack of suitable NGL-3 antibodies.
However, our previous electron microscopy results, obtained using a
pan-NGL antibody, indicate that NGL isoforms are mainly postsynaptically localized at excitatory synapses13. The presynaptic localization of
LAR in C. elegans and Drosophila has been well characterized28,32,33,36,
although the pre- or postsynaptic localization of mammalian LAR
remains to be determined34. On the basis of the widespread distribution of both mRNAs, determined by in situ hybridization13,41, the
adhesion between NGL-3 and LAR probably occurs in various brain
regions. Notably, NGL-3 proteins are mainly expressed in the brain
(Fig. 2b), whereas LAR mRNAs, determined by Northern analysis, are
expressed in various tissues42, suggesting that the interaction between
NGL-3 and LAR occurs primarily in the brain.
The three NGL isoforms share an identical domain structure and
interact with PSD-95 through their extreme C termini12,13. However,
their primary sequences are substantially different (especially in their

cytoplasmic domains), suggesting that NGL isoforms have different
functions. In support of this notion, NGLs interact with netrin-Gs in an
isoform-specific manner: NGL-1 and NGL-2 interact with netrin-G1
and netrin-G2, respectively, whereas NGL-3 binds neither netrin-G1
nor netrin-G2 (ref. 13). Our data indicate that NGL-3, which to date
has remained an orphan receptor, selectively associates with LAR,
whereas NGL-1 and NGL-2 do not bind LAR. This suggests that the
extracellular domains of NGLs, despite their close amino acid sequence
identity relative to the cytoplasmic region, are functionally distinct.
Consistently, NGL-3 was more efficient than NGL-1 and NGL-2 in
inducing presynaptic differentiation in mixed-culture assays, although
they had comparable surface expression levels.
Taken together with previous results, our data indicate that the two
different types of NGL ligands, netrin-G1/2 and LAR, have both similar
and contrasting features. Extensive alternative splicing is observed in
both netrin-Gs21–23 and LAR43,44, suggesting that alternative splicing
may regulate the NGL-3–LAR adhesion, as shown in the splicingdependent LAR interaction with nidogen35. NGL-3 expression, however, is probably not regulated by alternative splicing, as the NGL-3
gene (LRRC4B) has only two coding exons. Netrin-Gs are unique in
that they are GPI-anchored proteins21,22. In addition, netrin-G2 does
not induce postsynaptic differentiation in contacting dendrites when it
is expressed in non-neural cells13. These results suggest that netrin-Gs
may require an additional co-receptor for its functional interaction
with NGL-2. In contrast, LAR is a transmembrane protein with the
ability to induce postsynaptic differentiation in contacting dendrites,
suggesting that LAR alone may be sufficient to function as a presynaptic
NGL-3 receptor.
The NGL-3–LAR interaction is similar to the well-known adhesion
between neuroligin and neurexin in that a heterophilic trans-synaptic
adhesion mediates synapse formation in a bidirectional manner7–9. In
addition, when it is expressed in non-neural cells, NGL-3 induced both
excitatory and inhibitory presynaptic differentiation in contacting
axons, similar to neuroligins9, which induce excitatory and inhibitory
presynaptic differentiation by interacting with neurexins that are
present in both glutamatergic and GABAergic axons9. Localization of
LAR at excitatory synapses is supported by the role of LAR in the
development and maintenance of excitatory synapses34. Whether LAR
is present at inhibitory synapses remains to be determined. It should be
noted that NGL-3 that is expressed in neurons selectively induces
excitatory presynaptic contacts, contrary to the results from mixed
cultured assays. This might be attributable to the interaction of NGL-3
with postsynaptic proteins that promote excitatory presynaptic differentiation in contacting axons.
LAR expressed in non-neural cells selectively induced excitatory
postsynaptic protein clustering in contacting dendrites, unlike neurexin
1b, which induces both excitatory and inhibitory postsynaptic protein
clustering9. Neurexin 1b induces excitatory and inhibitory postsynaptic
protein clustering by interacting with both neuroligin 1 and neuroligin 2
(ref. 9), which have specific excitatory and inhibitory synaptic localizations, respectively4,5. The selective excitatory postsynaptic protein clustering by LAR may arise from LAR’s association with NGL-3 at
excitatory synapses. This is consistent with our observation that direct
dendritic clustering of NGL-3 selectively induced excitatory postsynaptic
protein clustering, and suggests that it is unlikely that there are unknown
LAR-binding postsynaptic adhesion molecules at inhibitory synapses.

How might NGL-3 and LAR lead to post- and presynaptic differentiation, respectively? One possible mechanism by which synaptic
adhesion molecules contribute to synapse formation is by interacting
with and promoting the synaptic localization of specific membrane and
cytoplasmic proteins. PSD-95, which interacts with NGL-3, is an
abundant postsynaptic protein that interacts with a variety of membrane, signaling and scaffolding/adaptor proteins of excitatory
synapses. Therefore, PSD-95 may couple NGL-3–dependent synaptic
adhesion to the localization of various postsynaptic proteins.
Liprin-a, which binds to the membrane-distal phosphatase domain
of LAR, may act together with LAR to mediate NGL-3–dependent
presynaptic differentiation. Liprin-a has been implicated in the regulation of active zone assembly and presynaptic development through its
interactions with synaptic proteins, including ERC/ELKS, RIM and
CASK28. Studies on liprin-a homologs in C. elegans (SYD-2) and
Drosophila (Dliprin-a) have firmly established the roles of liprin-a in
presynaptic differentiation31,32,45,46.
Another LAR-interacting cytoplasmic protein that may contribute to
LAR-dependent presynaptic differentiation is b-catenin, a component
of the cadherin-catenin complex30. Presynaptic b-catenin localizes the
reserve pool of vesicles to presynaptic sites through mechanisms
involving interaction of its C terminus with synaptic PDZ proteins47.
Notably, brain-derived neurotrophic factor activation of the TrkB
receptor tyrosine kinase regulates tyrosine phosphorylation of
b-catenin, which disrupts the cadherin–b-catenin interaction and
promotes synaptic vesicle splitting and synapse formation48.
Considering that LAR dephosphorylates b-catenin30,34, LAR and
TrkB may reciprocally regulate b-catenin–dependent presynaptic
vesicle clustering.
One possibility is that the binding of NGL-3 to LAR may regulate the
tyrosine phosphatase activity of LAR. Receptor tyrosine phosphatases
can be negatively regulated by dimerization49. However, a study on the
crystallographic structure of the phosphatase domain of LAR has
suggested that the phosphatase activity of LAR is probably not
regulated by dimerization50.
In conclusion, our results suggest that the trans-synaptic interaction
between NGL-3 and LAR regulates excitatory synapse formation in a
bidirectional manner. Future investigations will aim to explore
possible functional interactions between NGL-1/2–netrin-Gs and
NGL-3–LAR adhesions.
METHODS
DNA constructs and antibodies. Full-length human NGL-1 (NM_020929,
amino acids 1–641) and rat NGL-3 (XM_218615, amino acids 1–709) were
subcloned into pEGFP-N1 (Clontech). Human LAR (amino acids 1–1881) was
subcloned into pECFP-N1 (Clontech). For small interfering RNA knockdown,
nucleotides 359–377 of rat NGL-3 (GCA AGA ATC TGG TGC GCA A), its
point mutant (GCA AGT CTC TTG TGC GCA A) and nucleotides 1,254–1,272
(GCA CGA TGG CAC ACT CAA T) were subcloned into pSuper.gfp/
neo (OligoEngine) to generate shNGL-3 #1, shNGL-3* and shNGL-3 #2,
respectively. The extracellular domain of LAR (amino acids 1–1,235) was
subcloned into pEGFP-N1, in which EGFP was replaced with human Fc. Other
constructs, antibodies and reagents are described in the Supplementary
Methods online.
Mixed-culture assay. Mixed-culture assays were carried out as described39.
Briefly, primary hippocampal neuron cultures at 10 d in vitro (10 DIV)
prepared from embryonic day 18–19 (E18–19) rats were cocultured with
HEK293T cells expressing NGLs, LAR or EGFP, followed by immunostaining
at 13 DIV. For the synaptotagmin I antibody uptake assay, neurons were
incubated with antibodies to the synaptotagmin luminal domain at the dilution
of 1:10 in isotonic depolarizing solution for 5 min. For competitive inhibition,
LAR-ecto-Fc proteins (10 mg ml1) were added to NGL-3–expressing HEK293T
cells that were cocultured with neurons for 3 d (10–13 DIV).
Transfection of neurons and immunocytochemistry. Cultured neurons were
transfected using a mammalian transfection kit (Clontech) and fixed with 4%
paraformaldehyde/4% sucrose (vol/vol), permeabilized with 0.2% Triton X-100
(vol/vol) in phosphate-buffered saline, incubated with primary antibodies and
then incubated with Cy3-, Cy5- or FITC-conjugated secondary antibodies
(Jackson ImmunoResearch). For the inhibition of endogenous synapses
with soluble LAR, neurons were treated with LAR-ecto-Fc for 3 d
(20 mg ml1, 7/8–10/11 DIV) and transfected with pEGFP-N1 for visualization
(9/10–10/11 DIV).
Bead and antibody aggregation assays. Bead aggregation assays were performed as described previously13. Briefly, neutravidin-conjugated FluoSphere
beads (Molecular Probes) were pre-incubated with biotin-conjugated antibodies to EGFP. The antibody-coated beads were added onto neurons expressing
EGFP–NGL-3 (14–16 DIV) and cultured for 24 h. For antibody aggregation,
antibodies to EGFP were clustered by FITC-conjugated antibodies to guinea pig
in complete neurobasal medium and added to neurons at 16 DIV, followed by
24-h culture and immunofluorescence staining at 17 DIV.
Image acquisition and quantification. All z-stacked images were randomly
acquired by confocal microscopy (LSM510, Zeiss) and analyzed with MetaMorph image analysis software (Universal Imaging). The density of synaptic
protein clusters was measured from 15–30 neurons; the primary dendritic
lengths of B50 mm from the cell body were measured for each neuron. For
quantification of images from coculture assays, all captured images were
thresholded and the integrated intensity of the clusters on transfected
HEK293T cells was normalized to the cell area. All values are presented as
mean ± s.e.m. and analyzed by Student’s t test or ANOVA Tukey’s test.
Quantitative cell surface–binding assay. HEK293T cells transfected with
NGL-3 were transferred to 96-well plates and grown for 24 h. After fixation
in 4% paraformaldehyde/4% sucrose, cells were incubated with increasing
concentrations of LAR-ecto-Fc for 1 h, incubated with horseradish peroxidase–
conjugated antibodies to human Fc (Sigma, 1:10,000) and color reacted with
TMB (Sigma).
Electrophysiology. Cultured pyramidal neurons from the hippocampus transfected with shNGL-3 (13–16 DIV) were whole-cell voltage clamped at 60 mV
using an Axopatch 200B amplifier (Axon Instruments). The extracellular
solution contained 145 mM NaCl, 2.5 mM KCl, 10 mM HEPES, 1.25 mM
NaH2PO4, 2 mM CaCl2, 1 mM MgCl2, 10 mM glucose and 0.4 mM sodium
ascorbate. The intracellular solution contained 100 mM potassium gluconate,
20 mM KCl, 10 mM HEPES, 8 mM NaCl, 4 mM magnesium ATP, 0.3 mM
sodium GTP and 0.5 mM EGTA. For mEPSC measurement, tetrodotoxin
(10 nM, Tocris) and bicuculline (10 mM, Tocris) were added into the
extracellular solution. Synaptic currents were analyzed using a custom-written
macro in Igor Pro (WaveMetrics).
