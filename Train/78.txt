Innate immune cells play a key role in the pathogenesis of multiple
sclerosis and experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE).
Current clinical imaging is restricted to visualizing secondary effects of inflammation, such as gliosis and blood–brain barrier disruption. Advanced molecular imaging, such as iron oxide
nanoparticle imaging, can allow direct imaging of cellular and molecular activity, but the exact cell types that phagocytose nanoparticles in vivo and how phagocytic activity relates to disease
severity is not well understood. In this study we used MRI to
map inflammatory infiltrates using high-field MRI and fluorescently labeled cross-linked iron oxide nanoparticles for cell tracking. We confirmed nanoparticle uptake and MR detectability ex
vivo. Using in vivo MRI, we identified extensive nanoparticle signal in the cerebellar white matter and circumscribed cortical gray
matter lesions that developed during the disease course (4.6-fold
increase of nanoparticle accumulation in EAE compared with
healthy controls, P < 0.001). Nanoparticles showed good cellular
specificity for innate immune cells in vivo, labeling activated microglia, infiltrating macrophages, and neutrophils, whereas there was
only sparse uptake by adaptive immune cells. Importantly, nanoparticle signal correlated better with clinical disease than conventional gadolinium (Gd) imaging (r, 0.83 for nanoparticles vs. 0.71 for
Gd-imaging, P < 0.001). We validated our approach using the Food
and Drug Administration-approved iron oxide nanoparticle ferumoxytol. Our results show that noninvasive molecular imaging of innate
immune responses can serve as an imaging biomarker of disease
activity in autoimmune-mediated neuroinflammation with potential
clinical applications in a wide range of inflammatory diseases.
MRI | nanoparticle imaging | USPIO | multiple sclerosis | EAE
Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a devastating neurological condition that exhibits predominant white matter (WM) but also
gray matter (GM) injury (1). Its animal model, experimental
autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE), mimics important aspects of the disease. EAE is characterized by severe demyelination and axonal degeneration caused by infiltrating T cells,
B cells, and innate immune cells (2). It is well established that
innate immune cells, including tissue-resident microglia and
recruited macrophages, are potent mediators of tissue damage
(3). Blocking their activity or skewing macrophages toward an
anti-inflammatory subtype ameliorates EAE and MS. Clinical
diagnosis and treatment monitoring are performed mainly by
MRI (4). So far, MRI markers of the disease are based on indirect
parameters such as edema, gliosis, and the disruption of the
blood–brain barrier (BBB) [as assessed by gadolinium (Gd) contrast agents]. Recently, additional contrast agents have become
available that are based on magnetic nanoparticles with phagocyte
tropism to target inflammatory effector cells directly (5). These
nanoparticles (ultra small paramagnetic iron oxide nanoparticles,
USPIOs) are phagocytosed by activated tissue-resident phagocytes
and circulating myeloid effector cells that migrate to inflammatory
sites. Thus, magnetic nanoparticle-enhanced MRI allows cell
tracking and an estimation of the inflammatory burden. Direct
imaging of effector cells that mediate inflammation and tissue
damage would be desirable but has not been introduced into
clinical practice despite several preclinical and clinical feasibility studies (6–12). For the detection of active MS lesions,
Gd-enhanced imaging remains the gold standard but has limited
Significance
Multiple sclerosis is a devastating neurological condition that can
affect the entire central nervous system. Innate immune cells
mediate the underlying tissue damage, but visualizing these
cellular culprits is currently not possible. Diagnosis and treatment
monitoring are performed by MRI, but so far imaging markers are
unspecific and based on secondary parameters (edema/gliosis;
blood–brain barrier disruption). We used a nanoparticle-based
approach to image brain-resident and infiltrating innate immune
cells in inflammatory lesions. Nanoparticle uptake is specific for
innate immune cells and correlates with clinical severity. Thus,
targeting innate immunity by molecular imaging may serve as a
direct marker of disease activity with the potential of clinical
translation to a wide variety of inflammatory conditions for improved diagnosis and treatment monitoring.

sensitivity and specificity. Here, USPIOs might add diagnostic
value (6). Gd visualizes only BBB disruption (BBB-D), a nonspecific effect of inflammation or other pathological states. One
unresolved controversy relates to the cell types targeted by magnetic nanoparticles (e.g., monocytes, macrophages, or neutrophils); but assessing targeting specificity is difficult in human
studies. In this preclinical study we used cross-linked iron oxide
nanoparticles (CLIOs), a well-studied nanoparticle in cancer
(13–15). We hypothesized that after the activation and homing
of macrophages to inflammatory sites, nanoparticle-labeled immune cells could be visualized and quantified within EAE lesions. Labeling of CLIO with fluorescent dyes was used to
validate MRI signals using innovative ultramicroscopy (UM) of
cleared brains, confocal microscopy, and flow cytometry. Flow
cytometric analyses were performed to phenotype inflammatory
infiltrates. Finally, we used the Food and Drug Administration
(FDA)-approved iron oxide nanoparticle ferumoxytol (16–20) to
corroborate the clinical potential of our approach.
Materials and Methods
EAE Induction. Female SJL mice (6–12 wk old) were obtained from Jackson
Laboratories. EAE was induced by s.c. injecting 200 μg proteolipid protein (PLP)
peptide (PLP139–151; GenScript), emulsified in 50 μL PBS and 50 μL of complete
Freund’s adjuvant (BD Difco, Fisher Scientific) containing 4 mg/mL heatinactivated Mycobacterium tuberculosis H37 Ra (BD Difco, Fisher Scientific).
Two hundred nanograms of pertussis toxin (PTx) (List Biological Laboratories) dissolved in 200 μL PBS was administered i.p. on days 0 and 2. The animal
protocol was approved by the animal welfare authority (G-212-13, Regierungspräsidium Karlsruhe) and the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (Massachusetts General Hospital). Additional details are given in SI Materials and Methods.
MRI. MRI was performed on a 9.4-Tesla (T) horizontal-bore small animal MRI
scanner (BioSpec 94/20 USR; Bruker BioSpin GmbH) with a four-channel phasedarray surface receiver coil. The brain MRI protocol included a T2-weighted
(T2-w) rapid acquisition with relaxation enhancement (RARE) sequence to
assess edema and a T1-weighted (T1-w) fast low-angle shot (FLASH) sequence to
assess BBB-D after Gd administration. A T2*-w FLASH sequence (21) was used
to assess USPIO uptake. For magnetic nanoparticle imaging, we i.v. injected
mice with CLIO-FITC, CLIO-TAMRA (kindly provided by R. Weissleder,
Massachusetts General Hospital, Harvard Medical School, Boston), or ferumoxytol
(Feraheme; AMAG Pharmaceuticals Inc.) at a concentration of 15 mg/kg diluted in
150 μL PBS. Additional details are given in SI Materials and Methods.
Clearing of Mouse Brains and Acquisition of UM Data. For UM analysis whole
brains were optically cleared using the FluorClearBABB protocol (22, 23).
Additional details are given in SI Materials and Methods.
Histology and Immunohistochemistry. For histological correlation analysis, mice
were killed in deep anesthesia by intracardial perfusion with PBS, followed by 4%
paraformaldehyde (PFA, Roti-Histofix; Carl Roth). Brains were dissected and either
snap-frozen in Tissue-Tek optimum cutting temperature (O.C.T.) compound
(VWR) or processed for standard paraffin histology. Five to ten-micrometer
cryostat or microtome sections were cut. Stainings were performed with ionized
calcium-binding adaptor molecule 1 (Iba-1) antibody (WAKO) for macrophages/
microglia, with CD3 antibody (Dako) for T cells, with CD45R antibody (eBioscience) for B cells, and with myeloperoxidase (MPO) antibody (Abcam) using
standard immunohistochemistry protocols. Tile scans (20× of the entire cerebellum, midbrain, and cortex) and higher-magnification images (60×) were acquired by confocal microscopy (Olympus FV1000 or Zeiss LSM700). Additional
details are given in SI Materials and Methods.
Isolation of Immune Cells and Flow Cytometry. SJL mice were killed by an
overdose of 100 mg/kg ketamine and 20 mg/kg xylazine (kx), and blood was
drawn from the heart before intracardial perfusion with PBS. Brain, spinal
cord, bone marrow, liver, spleen, and lymph nodes were excised. The cerebrum and cerebellum were homogenized separately. Brain leukocytes were
isolated and used for flow cytometry as previously described (24). Additional
details are given in SI Materials and Methods.
Statistical Analysis. Data are shown as mean ± SEM. Statistical analyses were
performed in PRISM (GraphPad). Additional details in SI Materials and Methods.
Results
Cultured Macrophages Take up CLIO-FITC and Can Be Imaged by MRI.
First, we examined the capacity of macrophages and microglia to
phagocytose CLIO nanoparticles (Fig. 1 A and B). Monocytes
from the bone marrow of healthy mice were isolated, cultivated
in vitro, and polarized into M1- or M2-like macrophages using
chemokine mixtures (25). We found that the two macrophage
subtypes phagocytosed particles to a similar degree (Fig. 1C). The
proportion of CLIO-labeled macrophages increased in a dosedependent manner (Fig. 1 D and E). Importantly, in vitro-loaded
macrophages exhibited a clear, dose-dependent signal drop when
imaged by T2*-w MRI at 9.4 T (105 cells loaded with either 100
or 500 μg/mL of CLIO) (Fig. 1F). This result indicated that
CLIO particle imaging should be feasible for in vivo studies.
PLP-Induced EAE Results in Rapidly Progressing Inflammatory Lesions.
After EAE induction the first clinical symptoms developed
rapidly, 6–12 d after immunization (Fig. 2 A and B). At disease
onset (baseline MRI) animals were imaged by high-field 9.4-T
MRI using T2-w, T2*-w, and T1-w post-Gd contrast sequences
(Fig. 2C). Strong, confluent Gd enhancement and concomitant
edema were present in the cerebellar WM and around the meninges. Gd enhancement, however, represents only BBB-D rather
than actual inflammation. Hence, more direct means to assess inflammation by MRI would be desirable (26). To determine whether
more specific imaging of inflammation and cell tracking was possible
in our model, we i.v. injected CLIO-FITC. CLIO injection led to an
immediate loss of vascular signal and the delineation of the vasculature (Fig. S1A). Forty-eight hours after CLIO administration, free
particles were largely cleared from the circulation and had accumulated in immune cells of spleen, liver, lymph nodes, blood, and bone
marrow, as assessed by MRI and flow cytometry (Fig. S1). This time
point (onset + 2) was used for follow-up MRI to assess cellular influx.
T2*-w imaging before contrast administration (pre CLIO) outlines
venules because of the blood oxygenation level-dependent (BOLD)
contrast of deoxygenized blood (Fig. 2C). Forty-eight hours after
CLIO administration (post CLIO) additional linear and punctate
susceptibility signals were found (Fig. 2D). CLIO deposition in the
cerebellum localized mainly to the WM, and image subtraction (post
CLIO minus pre CLIO) facilitated its identification (Fig. 2E).

Because T2* imaging is prone to image artifacts caused by magnetic
field inhomogeneity and motion of the animal (e.g., breathing), T2*
imaging of CLIO-injected animals was performed in a subset of
animals ex vivo after brain explantation to confirm iron particle deposition. Strong susceptibility signals were found in the cerebellum,
basal ganglia, and cortex. Such signals were found only in diseased
animals; healthy animals did not show nanoparticle uptake (Fig. 2F).
Nanoparticle Uptake Correlates with Clinical Disease Severity.
Quantification of T2* images revealed a 4.6-fold increase in cerebellar susceptibility signals 48 h after CLIO injection in diseased
animals (cerebellar volume of T2* signal drop before injection:
1.33 ± 0.50 mm3
, vs. 6.14 ± 0.82 mm3 after CLIO injection, P <
0.001) (Fig. 2G). Importantly, the volume of the decrease in T2*
signal in the cerebellum correlated better with disease severity
(Spearman’s r: 0.83, P < 0.001) than did conventional Gd enhancement (Spearman’s r: 0.71, P < 0.01) (Fig. 2 H and I).
Nanoparticles Localize to Infiltrating Macrophages and Resident
Microglia in Vivo. To validate that iron oxide nanoparticles indeed accumulate in inflammatory phagocytic cells, we performed
immunohistochemical stainings for Iba-1, a marker for macrophages and microglia (27). Dense infiltrates of Iba-1+ macrophages
and microglia were present throughout the cerebellar WM and had
largely phagocytosed nanoparticles (Fig. 3A). Immunohistochemical quantifications showed that most macrophages/microglia infiltrates localize to the WM (7.0 × 102 Iba-1+ cells/mm2 in the WM
compared with 4.6 × 102
/mm2 in the GM and 1.6 × 102
/mm2 in the
cerebellar WM of healthy controls, P < 0.05) (Fig. 3B). Most
macrophages/microglia had accumulated CLIO-FITC (P < 0.05)
(Fig. 3C). B cells and T cells did not show CLIO-FITC uptake
(Fig. 3 D and E). In some animals Gd-enhanced MRI also showed
prominent lesions in the midbrain (24%, n = 8 mice from 33 animals total, four independent experiments) and cortex (30%,
n = 10 mice), with concomitant iron oxide deposition (Fig. 3 F and
G). Immunohistochemistry showed infiltrates of macrophages/
microglia with particle uptake (Fig. 3 H and I). The levels of uptake
in the cortex were considerably smaller than in the cerebellum
(3.7 ± 0.6 × 102 Iba-1+/CLIO+ cells/mm2 in the cerebellum vs. 1.1 ±
0.2 × 102 cells/mm2 in the cortex; P < 0.05). To better understand
how CLIO labels microglia, we killed EAE animals 2 h after CLIO
administration after having proven BBB-D by Gd-enhanced MRI
(Fig. S2A). CLIO was present both around blood vessels and in the
parenchyma within inflammatory lesions close to Iba-1+ cells (Fig.
S2 B and C). However, macrophages/microglia were CLIO− at this
early time point (Fig. S2B), indicating that they phagocytose free
particles over time. CD31+ vessels did not show CLIO uptake when
assessed 48 h after CLIO injection (Fig. S2D). Next, we assessed
axonal pathology and demyelination, both hallmarks of EAE and
MS. We found large demyelinated areas in the cerebellar WM in
Luxol Fast Blue stainings. Corresponding regions showed severe
axonal damage with disrupted tissue morphology on neurofilament
protein (NFP) stainings (Fig. S2 E and F). Inflammatory changes as
assessed by immunohistochemistry for the inflammatory enzyme
MPO were present in the WM and GM matter of the cerebellum
(Fig. 3J). To assess the 3D distribution of the nanoparticles further,
we performed tissue clearing with FluorClearBABB (23). Clearing of
EAE brains and UM confirmed widespread lesions in the cerebellar
WM, cortex, and midbrain (Fig. 3K and Movie S1). In contrast, there
were no MRI signal changes, CLIO particle uptake, or MPO expression in healthy control animals (Fig. 3K and Fig. S3).
Nanoparticle Uptake Occurs Predominantly in the Acute Phase of the
Disease. To determine the degree of macrophage influx during
the remission phase of EAE, we performed a time-course experiment. After the administration of CLIO-FITC at the onset
of disease, we reinjected the same animal with CLIO-TAMRA
in the remission phase (10–14 d after symptom onset), followed
by MRI and histological assessment (Fig. 2A). On immunohistochemical analysis we found predominantly CLIO-FITC
that was widespread within the cerebellum but only traces of

CLIO-TAMRA. Macrophages/microglia were present only around
major vessels, and most focal cerebellar lesions had resolved (Fig.
S4A). Also, when we quantified Iba-1+
cells, we only found a minor
increase in macrophages/microglia compared with healthy control
animals (a 3.3-fold increase of Iba-1+ cells in the cerebellar WM,
P < 0.01, n = 3 mice). Iba-1+ cell numbers and CLIO uptake in the
cerebellar GM were not statistically different in remission-phase
animals and healthy control animals, indicating that inflammation
had mostly resolved (P > 0.05) (Fig. S4 B and C).
The Majority of Myeloid Effector Cells Phagocytose Nanoparticles. To
better understand the cellular contribution to the MRI signal at
the single cell level, we performed flow cytometry analysis. Cerebellum and cerebrum were assessed separately because the cerebellum is more severely affected by the disease than the cerebrum.
EAE brains were isolated into single cells and stained for CD45,
CD11b, and Ly6G to differentiate infiltrating macrophages (CD11b+
,
CD45high, Ly-6G−
), resident microglia (CD11b+
, CD45intermediate/low),
and neutrophils (Ly-6G+, CD45+). We further stained T cells
(CD45high, CD11b−, CD3+, CD4+, or CD8+) and B cells
(CD45high, CD11b−, B220+) (Fig. 4 A and B and Fig. S5 A and
B). As expected there was a marked increase of macrophages,
microglia, and neutrophils in EAE (11.9 ± 2.7% of macrophages
compared with <1% in the healthy brain, P < 0.05; 21.0 ± 4.2%
of microglia vs. 6.4 ± 1.6%, P = 0.05) (Fig. 4 C–G). A large
proportion of these inflammatory myeloid effector cells took up
CLIO (49.0 ± 7.1% of cerebellar macrophages in EAE vs. 9.9 ±
2.8% in the healthy control, P < 0.01) (Fig. 4 C, F, and G). To
pinpoint further the extent to which different macrophage subtypes contribute to nanoparticle uptake, we stained for Ly-6C,
a marker of macrophage activation (28). In line with our ex vivo
polarization experiments, Ly-6Chigh and Ly-6Clow monocytes/
macrophages did not differ significantly in their degree of nanoparticle uptake, although there was a trend toward more uptake by
the Ly-6Chigh subpopulation (P > 0.05) (Fig. S5C). The strong nanoparticle uptake of myeloid effector cells was in contrast to T cells and
B cells, which took up significantly less CLIO (11.4 ± 3.5%, P = 0.01
compared with macrophages), and the innate immune cell compartment encompassed >85% of all CLIO+ leukocytes (Fig. S5D).
Similar results were obtained in the cerebrum, with largely innate
immune cell labeling and only sparse labeling of adaptive immune
cells (Fig. 4 E and G) and spinal cord (Fig. S5E). Interestingly, both
the macrophage number and the degree of CLIO uptake correlated
with the clinical score of the individual animal (Spearman’s r: 0.72,
P < 0.001, and 0.76, P < 0.001, respectively) (Fig. 4 H and I).
MR Imaging with the FDA-Approved Compound Ferumoxytol Confirms
Clinical Applicability. To validate the clinical potential of our approach, we used the FDA-approved iron oxide nanoparticle ferumoxytol to image inflammatory lesions in acute EAE. Using the
same approach as with the experimental CLIO particle, we found
a precise delineation of hypointense ferumoxytol signal, mainly in
the cerebellar WM (Fig. 5 A–C). Quantification of the ferumoxytol
signal showed a 5.8-fold increase in hypointense signal 24 h after
ferumoxytol administration (volume of signal decrease for ferumoxytol: 5.8 ± 0.7 mm3 vs. 1.0 ± 0.3 mm3 before ferumoxytol,
P = 0.01) (Fig. 5D). Iron staining confirmed iron-positive cells
(most likely macrophages/microglia) in the cerebellar WM in
ferumoxytol-injected animals which were not detectable in healthy
control animals (Fig. 5E).
Discussion
Diagnosis and monitoring of disease activity in MS is mainly based on
Gd-enhanced MRI (29, 30), which assesses the integrity of the BBB.
However, Gd imaging has limited sensitivity and specificity and does
not reflect the activity of cellular disease mediators (30). Moreover,
its correlation to important clinical parameters (like the Expanded
Disability Status Scale) and to pathological hallmarks such as demyelination and neurodegeneration is limited (30). Direct imaging of
molecular targets or cellular effector cells of tissue damage would be
highly desirable (8, 26, 31, 32). We have established a protocol to
image myeloid effector cells and BBB-D sequentially using innovative
magnetic nanoparticles followed by Gd-imaging. Our results illustrate
that the T2* signal attenuation specifically shows different innate
immune cells (macrophages, activated microglia, and neutrophils).
Furthermore, MRI signal quantification of phagocytic activity correlates with disease severity. This correlation was confirmed on the
cellular level where CLIO uptake by macrophages correlated significantly with the clinical score. Iron oxide nanoparticle imaging has
been performed in a wide variety of diseases (16, 17, 33–35), but
apart from liver imaging (36), iron oxide imaging has not yet been
translated into clinical practice, partially because of economic, safety,
and technical reasons (37–40). However, imaging of inflammation is
of major clinical interest. Areas of unmet need that would require
imaging of inflammation and immune cell responses include
immunotherapy of cancer and autoimmune conditions such as

MS. For these applications, iron oxide nanoparticles could allow
patient stratification and treatment monitoring (19, 33, 41).
The current study extends previous work on USPIOs that were
used mainly in cardiovascular disease, in tumor models, and in
small clinical trials (13, 16, 17). In the present study we first confirmed the efficient labeling of macrophages and microglia in vitro.
We further validated that macrophages, microglia, and neutrophils
take up USPIOs in vivo and quantified the uptake for each cell
type. Despite evidence that neutrophils may promote autoimmune
neuroinflammation (42), the high frequency of Ly-6G+ cells may
signify that this population also contains eosinophils, differentiating
premonocytes, or plasmacytoid dendritic cells, all of which have
been reported to express Ly6-G under certain conditions, and
might be present in EAE lesions. Nanoparticle uptake by adaptive
immune cells was only marginal, indicating that nanoparticle imaging is predominantly a marker of innate immunity. We found
that in healthy animals innate CD11b+ cells take up CLIO by a
much higher frequency than T cells and B cells and also phagocytose more particles per cell. We calculated that 86–94% of the
signal originates from myeloid cells, depending on the respective
organ (e.g., spleen vs. blood). In EAE we identified CLIO labeling
of T cells and B cells by flow cytometry (up to 20% of T cells).
Again, myeloid cells take up more CLIO per cell based on median
fluorescence intensity in flow cytometry. In immunohistochemistry
we did not detect CLIO uptake by B cells or T cells. Taking these
findings together, we estimate that more than 90% of the nanoparticle signal in EAE originates from innate immune cells (Fig.
S5D). The degree of adaptive immune cell labeling, which would
partially diminish the specificity of the imaging approach, is most
likely the result of the uptake mechanism. It has been proposed
that macropinocytosis is the entry mechanism of iron oxide
nanoparticles, a mechanism that most cell types are capable of
using, although to a very different degree (5). Thus, we concluded
that our imaging approach in EAE shows innate immune responses, but signal origin in other disease models will depend on
the cellular micromilieu of the respective pathology.
We also illustrate different lesion types (cerebellar WM and
GM, midbrain, and cortical lesions) that evolve in this MS
model. Severe inflammation was also present in the spinal cord.
In contrast to myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein (MOG) EAE
in C57BL/6 mice, which exhibits mainly spinal pathology, PLP
immunization in SJL mice leads to widespread cerebral pathology (31, 32). We found prominent immune cell infiltrates mostly
in the cerebellum but also in the midbrain and cortex. This localization seems especially relevant because GM and cortical
pathology is of major clinical relevance (1, 43, 44), and so far
insights into the underlying mechanisms of neurodegeneration
are limited (45, 46). One limitation of many studies that use
experimental contrast agents relates to the clinical translatability
of the work. We used experimental CLIO particles that are not
available for clinical use but are well characterized in experimental models, are fluorescently labeled, and showed good uptake and biodistribution kinetics. To show the clinical potential,
we also performed experiments with the FDA-approved agent
ferumoxytol that has been used “off label” for human imaging
studies (18, 19). Using this agent, we validated our approach and
demonstrated that ferumoxytol imaging could be a valid strategy
for nanoparticle imaging in the clinical arena, although safety
issues with the agent might apply (37). In our study we used a
high-field preclinical MRI system (9.4 T) that has better sensitivity than 3T scanners for the detection of susceptibility signals
caused by iron oxide nanoparticles. Nevertheless, several studies
have demonstrated that USPIO imaging is feasible in the clinical
setting (17–19). Another limitation is the imaging target itself.
Although macrophages and microglia are important effector
cells in EAE and MS (3), our imaging approach does not reflect
the entire cellular complexity of the disease. B cells and T cells
are additional imaging targets that are more difficult to label by
iron oxide nanoparticles (13, 47). Another aspect is a possible
interaction of the particle with immune cell functions. Previous
studies have investigated the capacity of different human

immune cell populations to phagocytose USPIOs and the possible effects of particle labeling on immune cell function (48).
We did not observe differences in disease severity or onset in
USPIO-injected vs. noninjected animals, indicating that USPIO
labeling did not greatly interfere with immune cell function;
however, we did not investigate this issue in depth.
In summary, we demonstrate high sensitivity and cellular
specificity for innate immune cells using USPIO imaging in an MS
model and noninvasively track infiltrating neutrophils, macrophages, and activated microglia by longitudinal MRI. USPIO
imaging provides a tool for innate immune cell tracking that, in
contrast to conventional Gd imaging, reflects cellular disease
mechanisms. Thus, it can serve as an imaging biomarker for inflammatory disease severity and directly show the underlying cellular culprits of disease. This study could spur research to translate
iron oxide nanoparticle imaging into clinical practice for patients
suffering from MS and other innate immunity-driven diseases.
