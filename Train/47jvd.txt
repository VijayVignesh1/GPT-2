Human visual cortex responds to invisible
chromatic flicker
Yi Jiang1, Ke Zhou2 & Sheng He1
When two isoluminant colors alternate at frequencies of 25 Hz or higher, observers perceive only one fused color. Chromatic
flicker beyond the fusion frequency induces flicker adaptation in human observers and stimulates monkey V1 neurons. Here we
use functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to show that many human visual cortical areas, with the exception of VO, can
distinguish between fused chromatic flicker and its matched nonflickering control. This result supports the existence of significant
intracortical temporal filtering of high-frequency chromatic information. The result also suggests that a considerable difference in
cortical activation in many visual cortical areas does not necessarily lead to different conscious experiences.
Humans have a very efficient and powerful visual system, yet both its
spatial and temporal resolutions are limited. Spatial patterns that are
too fine and temporal fluctuations that are too fast are lost to our
perception. In the temporal domain, even under optimal conditions, we
cannot resolve luminance flicker faster than about 50 Hz and chromatic
flicker faster than 25 Hz1–4. Temporal modulations beyond the so-called
critical flicker frequencies (CFF) are no longer perceived as flicker. For
example, when two isoluminant colors alternate at frequencies of 25 Hz
or higher, observers perceive only one fused color. The human visual
system consists of multiple levels of neural processing, including retinal
and lateral geniculate nucleus stages, and many cortical stages. It is
natural to ask where in the system the resolution limit is imposed.
One naive yet intuitive and reasonable prediction of the bottleneck
for both spatial and temporal information processing would be that the
primary loss of resolution occurs at the link between subcortical
and cortical levels of processing. This idea is reasonable because if
the information is not eventually perceived, then why bother having
the information represented and processed cortically? However, both
neurophysiological and psychophysical studies have suggested that
invisible information can and does reach cortical neurons. For example,
color opponent neurons in V1 of macaque monkeys respond to
chromatic flicker at frequencies much higher than the CFF5. In
psychophysical studies, adapting to either luminance or chromatic
flicker at frequencies above their respective CFF can reduce observers’
flicker sensitivity6 and alternating colored patterns too fast to be
perceptible can still induce orientation contingent color aftereffects7.
Recordings of evoked potentials from human subjects also show the
so-called entrainment of the signal with the screen refresh8. However,
single-unit studies generally suffer from severe sampling limitations,
and psychophysical as well as VEP studies lack the ability to precisely
localize the neural sites. Thus it is challenging for these techniques to
investigate responses to fused chromatic flicker across multiple visual
areas. Although fMRI studies have investigated cortical responses to
chromatic modulation9, including its temporal properties10, and
demonstrated a correlation between parietal and frontal activation
and conscious perception of flicker11, it remains poorly understood
how temporal resolution limitations are imposed in the neural transformation in human visual cortex, especially for chromatic information.
In the current study, we investigated whether the human visual
cortex could distinguish fused chromatic flicker from its matched
nonflickering control using fMRI. An advantage of the fMRI approach
is that measures of cortical responses can be taken simultaneously at
multiple cortical areas, thus providing a more complete picture of how
the information is processed and transformed in the visual brain. Our
results show that fused chromatic flicker generated a substantially
higher response compared with a matched nonflickering control
stimulus in many early visual cortical areas, with the notable exception
of area VO/V8, a region selectively sensitive to color information10,12.
RESULTS
Retinotopic mapping and ROIs identification
Each subject was first scanned with the standard retinotopic mapping
procedure of viewing a rotating wedge and an expanding ring13. This
allowed us to identify the borders of different visual areas (V1, V2, V3/
VP, V3A and hV4/V4v) on a computationally flattened brain (Fig. 1).
An area just anterior to the hV4/V4v was also identified as a region of
interest (ROI). The exact topography and name of this region is still
controversial. One model suggests that hV4 (including the foveal part
of V4v) contains a complete hemifield representation, and the region
anterior to hV4 is labeled VO (VO-1, VO-2)14, whereas another model
treats this region as a distinct region from the V4v representation and
names it V8 (ref. 12). Our study does not address the topography of this
region and so far we have used an inclusive label VO/V8 to refer to this
region anterior to hV4/V4v. For simplicity, we will only use the label

VO, which in our study only includes the region outside the boundary
corresponding to the horizontal meridian activation (that is, outside
the last thin gray lines in Fig. 1b). Thus, the VO in our study does not
include the area extending peripherally from V4v, a controversial area
according to the two models. We should mention that the pattern of
activation found in this excluded part was similar to the near-foveal
region of the V4v (or hV4).
Chromatic flickering stimuli and matched controls were presented
to the four quadrants in the visual field as four pairs of wedges,
two pairs counter-phase flickering and two static (Fig. 1a). With
the identical spatial configuration, a full-contrast 5-Hz chromatic
flicker stimulus was used to localize the retinotopic regions
corresponding to the stimuli in visual cortex. We determined the
ROIs by combining the retinotopic map and the locations defined by
the 5-Hz full-contrast flicker stimulus. Detailed spatial locations of
ROIs hV4 and VO for each subject can be found in Supplementary
Table 1 online.
fMRI responses to resolved and fused chromatic flicker
We plotted BOLD signal time courses showing responses for V1, hV4
and VO to three chromatic flickers: 5-Hz flicker at full contrast and at
subthreshold contrast, and a 30-Hz flicker at full contrast (example
time course, Fig. 2a). Time course data are not shown from V2, V3/VP
and V3A, because they are very similar to the ones from V1 and hV4.
Not surprisingly, compared with the nonflickering static control, the
5-Hz full-contrast chromatic flicker evoked strong cortical responses in
each ROI of the visual areas we have identified (V1: t4 ¼ 15.67, P o
0.0005; V2: t4 ¼ 6.89, P o 0.005; V3/VP: t4 ¼ 8.27, P o 0.001; V3A:
t4 ¼ 7.78, P o 0.001; hV4: t4 ¼ 4.24, P o 0.02; VO: t4 ¼ 5.32, P o 0.01;
Fig. 2b). When the flicker frequency was 30 Hz, all four wedges
appeared static and observers could not distinguish which two of the
wedges were flickering. The BOLD signal measured in the corresponding ROIs of the visual cortex was substantially higher for a 30-Hz fused
chromatic flicker compared with a matched nonflickering control
stimulus in almost all of the visual areas identified, with the exception
of VO (V1: t4 ¼ 4.28, P o 0.02; V2: t4 ¼ 3.94, P o 0.02; V3/VP:
t4 ¼ 4.82, P o 0.01; V3A: t4 ¼ 8.17, P o
0.001; hV4: t4 ¼ 4.10, P o 0.02; VO: t4 ¼ 1.41,
P 4 0.2; Fig. 2b).
It is of particular interest to compare
response patterns in visual areas hV4 and
VO, as they are believed to be critical for
color selectivity and color perception10,12,14,15, although the properties
of visual field maps in this region are still controversial12,14. In the
current study, hV4 showed significant activation to the 30-Hz invisible
chromatic flicker, but VO did not. In addition, a subthreshold-level
5-Hz chromatic flicker, which also appeared to be static and perceptually matched to the 30-Hz chromatic flicker to observers, did not
generate a significantly higher response than the matched control
stimulus (V1: t4 ¼ 1.07, P 4 0.3; V2: t4 ¼ 1.01, P 4 0.3; V3/VP:
t4 ¼ 0.75, P 4 0.4; V3A: t4 ¼ 0.99, P 4 0.3; hV4: t4 ¼ –0.37, P 4 0.7;
VO: t4 ¼ 0.92, P 4 0.4; Fig. 2b).
fMRI signal as function of flicker frequency and contrast
The results described above show that human V1 to hV4 can
respond robustly to unresolved chromatic flicker compared with
perceptually matched static controls. In contrast, VO did not
respond differently to the unresolved flicker versus the static control.
However, because BOLD activity decreased quite significantly from
5-Hz to 30-Hz flicker in all areas measured, it is possible then that
response in VO simply reduced more rapidly compared with other
areas as a function of temporal frequency, even before the temporal
modulation exceeded the resolution limit. Another possibility is
that the contrast response function in VO may be more expansively
nonlinear, so that a small reduction in contrast would result in a
much more significant decrease in response. Either or both of these
two possibilities would explain the different pattern of response
found in VO.
We tested both of these possibilities in three subjects by measuring
the BOLD response at additional temporal frequencies (5, 15 and
30 Hz) and contrast levels (25, 50 and 100%). These contrast levels were
all above flicker detection threshold at 5 and 15 Hz, but were of course
below threshold for the 30-Hz flicker. We measured BOLD responses as
a function of temporal frequency at three contrast levels (Fig. 3a) and
BOLD contrast response functions at three flicker frequencies (Fig. 3b).
The results again showed that V1–hV4, but not VO responded robustly
to the fused 30-Hz chromatic flicker, replicating the first experiment. In
addition, no support could be found for either of the two alternative

explanations that motivated these additional measures. It is also clear
that the BOLD signals to chromatic flicker decreased as the temporal
frequency of the flicker increased for all of these test contrast levels and
in all ROIs (Fig. 3a). It is worth noting that between 5 and 15 Hz, the
BOLD signal reduction (slope) is comparable across all of these visual
areas. Further increasing the flicker frequency from 15 to 30 Hz
continued to reduce BOLD signal in V1–hV4 (Fig. 3a and Supplementary Fig. 1 online). However, VO showed a disproportionately
large reduction in BOLD signal when flicker frequency was increased
from 15 to 30 Hz. The contrast response
functions are similar across the different
visual areas; neither VO nor the other areas
showed dramatically different contrast
response functions (Fig. 3b and Supplementary Fig. 1). The exception, of course, is that
there is no measurable response in VO at
30 Hz at any of the contrast levels.
Perceptual equivalency between flicker and control stimuli
A key condition that allows us to interpret the results as indicating that
V1–hV4 could still resolve the 30-Hz perceptually fused chromatic
flicker is that the fused flicker was perceptually indistinguishable from
the static control and the subthreshold 5-Hz chromatic flicker. Before
subjects were scanned, they set the isoluminant red and green stimuli
using a minimal flicker technique. After the scans were finished, each
subject was further tested with a two-alternative forced choice (2AFC)
task, determining in each trial which of the two temporal intervals had

the 30-Hz flickering stimulus while the 30-Hz flicker was presented
randomly in either the first or the second interval and the static control
or the 5-Hz subthreshold flicker presented in the other interval.
Although subjects performed at chance level, discriminating between
the 30-Hz flicker and the other two control stimuli, such a result
does not rule out the possibility that the 30-Hz flicker stimulus
was perceptually different from the static control and the 5-Hz
subthreshold flicker.
Thus, we conducted another psychophysical experiment specifically
aimed at testing perceptual equivalency between the 30-Hz chromatic
flicker and the other two control stimuli. In this task, the stimuli were
essentially identical to the ones used during the scan. However, instead
of the 30-Hz flicker occupying two wedges and the control stimuli
occupying the other two (Fig. 1a), we had the 30-Hz flicker occupying
three wedges, which left one wedge (randomly selected) as the control
stimulus. In each 2-s trial, subjects had to decide which of the four
wedges was different from the other three. In other words, subjects
could perform this task above chance if the control stimuli were
perceived to be different in any way compared with the 30-Hz flicker.
In support of the perceptual equivalency between the 30-Hz flicker and
the static as well as the 5-Hz subthreshold control, subjects performed
at chance level (25%) in these four-alternative forced choice (4AFC)
tasks (detailed behavioral results can be found in Supplementary
Table 2 online, see Methods for more details).
DISCUSSION
The visual cortex showed a large BOLD signal when observers viewed a
5-Hz full contrast chromatic flicker. When the flicker frequency was
increased to 30 Hz and observers no longer perceived flicker, the
invisible flicker still generated a significantly higher BOLD response
than did a perceptually matched static stimulus in all of the visual areas
that we identified except the region VO (Fig. 2b).
To test the possibility that visual cortical areas could respond to
subthreshold chromatic flicker in general, rather than a selective
intracortical loss of high-frequency information, we also measured
BOLD signals to a subthreshold 5-Hz chromatic flicker in the same
scans. This subthreshold 5-Hz chromatic flicker was perceptually
indistinguishable from the 30-Hz chromatic
flicker to observers (this was verified with an
objective 2AFC task as well as a 4AFC task, see
Methods for details). Results show that the
response to the 5-Hz subthreshold flicker was
not different from that of the matched static
wedges in all visual areas. In other words,
observers had the same perception of static
wedges for the 5-Hz subthreshold flicker, the
30-Hz full contrast flicker and the physically
static wedges, yet their visual brain responded
more strongly to the 30-Hz flicker than to the
other two matched stimuli.
One possible model of the cortical representation of chromatic flicker is that the
flicker signal goes through increasing levels
of filtering from V1 to V2, V3/VP and so
forth. Such a model would predict that the
magnitude of the neural response to the
chromatic flicker, especially at high temporal
frequencies, would decrease as the flicker
signal ascends from primary visual areas to
extrastriate areas. However, the magnitude of
the BOLD signal from V1 to V2, V3/VP and
hV4 changes very little for either 5- or 30-Hz chromatic flicker; the
insensitivity to rapid chromatic flicker is specific to VO (Fig. 2b). Given
the complex origin and nature of the fMRI BOLD signal16, one needs to
be cautious when interpreting the magnitude data. Quantitative interpretation aside, it is clear in the current study that the visual brain
responds to the fused and invisible chromatic flicker not only in V1, but
in many other visual areas as well. More importantly, although there
was little change in the response magnitude from V1 to hV4, a
qualitative change in response occurred between hV4 and VO. When
the observers were not perceiving the 30-Hz flicker, the activity in VO
was unable to distinguish a 30-Hz flicker from a static control. This
finding is consistent with a recent imaging study that revealed significant chromatic (red-green) low-pass temporal filtering in VO, but
not in V1 and other early visual areas10.
The hV4 and VO regions have been suggested to be critical for color
selectivity and color perception10,12,14,15, and it is also likely that this
area was damaged in achromatopsic patients reported in clinical
studies17–19, although researchers are yet to reach consensus on the
functional properties and anatomical definition of this area12,14. The
area labeled as V8 (which significantly overlaps with the VO defined in
this paper) selectively responds to illusory colors12. Furthermore, early
studies revealed an area anterior to V4, but not V4 itself, in the right
fusiform gyrus that is selectively activated during color-imagery in both
normal sighted subjects20 and a blind patient21. In the current study,
hV4 responded to both the visible 5- and 15-Hz chromatic flickers, and
the invisible 30-Hz chromatic flicker, whereas VO was activated in
response to the visible 5- and 15-Hz flicker, but not the invisible 30-Hz
flicker. This pattern of current results, combined with previous
investigations, suggests that VO has a critical role in the conscious
representation of chromatic information, whereas hV4 and earlier areas
process color-related information more independently of the observers’
awareness state. To highlight this point, the bootstrapped BOLD signal
distributions based on all of the individual blocks from the primary
experiment are shown in two-dimensional plots (Fig. 4)22,23. We
plotted BOLD signals from V1 (Fig. 4a) and hV4 (Fig. 4b) against
BOLD signals from VO. Data from V2 and V3/VP are not shown here,
as they are similar to data from V1 and hV4. The three stimuli (5-Hz

full contrast chromatic flicker, 30-Hz full contrast chromatic flicker,
5-Hz subthreshold flicker control) could be classified either physically
(three conditions) or perceptually (two perceptual categories). BOLD
signals in areas V1 and hV4 clearly segregated into three distinct
distributions, whereas in VO there were only two distributions consistent with only two perceptions.
The results suggest that considerable differences in cortical activation
in early visual areas do not necessarily lead to different conscious
experiences. Much effort has been devoted to the role (or the lack
thereof) of V1 in visual awareness. One of the strongest pieces of
evidence suggesting that V1 is not part of the neural correlates of
consciousness is that responses in V1 exhibited variation between
perceptually equivalent conditions5,6,24–26. This is straightforward, yet
admittedly simplistic logic27. Given that almost all of the visual areas
responded to the invisible flicker, according to the same simple logic,
one would need to conclude that all of these areas are not part of the
neural correlates of consciousness. Alternatively, visual awareness may
always require the participation of multiple visual areas with both
feedforward and feedback connections28–32. Given such a model, no
area by itself is sufficient to support visual awareness. One should not
rule out a given cortical area as a participant in the neural correlate of
visual awareness simply on the basis of the observation that such an
area shows ‘unconscious activation’.
In summary, results show that many of the human visual cortical
areas, with the exception of VO, can distinguish between fused
chromatic flicker and its matched nonflickering control. Apparently,
considerable differences in cortical activation in visual cortical areas do
not necessarily lead to different conscious experiences.
METHODS
Participants. Five healthy subjects (two male) participated in the primary
experiment, and two of them and another naive subject participated in the
additional experiment to examine the BOLD response as a function of flicker
temporal frequency and contrast. All had normal or corrected-to-normal
vision, and gave written, informed consent in accordance with procedures
and protocols approved by the human subjects review committee of the
University of Minnesota.
Stimuli and procedure. Stimuli were presented through a LCD projector
(SANYO, Model PLC-XP41/L) onto a rear projection screen located behind the
participant’s head inside the magnet bore. The rise and fall times of the LCD
projector are about 10 ms and 2 ms, respectively, which was sufficiently fast to
allow the signal to reach peak modulation even at 30 Hz. The screen was viewed
with an angled mirror positioned on the head-coil. A central cross (0.31  0.31)
was always presented to subjects serving as the fixation. The stimuli consisted of
four wedges with each wedge extending to a visual angle of 3.51 in one of four
quadrants (see Fig. 1a). Each wedge also subtended a polar angle of 621 and
was distributed symmetrically along the diagonal axis. Two of the wedges in the
opposite direction were filled with isoluminant red (with chromatic CIE xy
coordinates of [0.523, 0.462]) and green (with chromatic CIE xy coordinates of
[0.343, 0.638]) colors with each color occupying one side of the diagonal line
(for example, the wedges in the second and the fourth quadrants as shown in
the left side of Fig. 1a); in these wedges, the isoluminant red and green lights
were synchronously exchanged at the flicker frequency. The other two (for
example, the wedges in the first and the third quadrants as shown in the left
side of Fig. 1a) were filled with a uniform and static yellow color with the mean
luminance of the red-green flicker. Thus there were two possible presentation
conditions for the chromatic flicker: the first/third quadrants and the second/
fourth quadrants. The whole wedge pattern was superimposed on a uniform
field whose intensity was equal to the mean luminance of each wedge
(824 cd m–2). The viewing distance was 102 cm.
In the primary experiment, there were three flickering conditions (5-Hz
flicker with full contrast, 30-Hz flicker with full contrast and 5-Hz flicker with
subthreshold contrast) and two possible display positions (the first/third
quadrants and the second/fourth quadrants), resulting in six combinations.
For each condition, stimuli were presented in a block design comprised of a
12-s probe followed by 12-s of uniform background. The 24-s cycle time was
chosen to minimize the effect of interference between the undershoot at the end
of one hemodynamic response with the start of the following one. A total of 18
blocks (each condition was repeated three times in a truly randomized order)
were presented in each run, and an additional 8-s blank period was added at the
start of the scan to minimize transient magnetic saturation effects. Thus, the
total scan time for each run was 440 s. The participants were asked to do a
demanding fixation task (detecting a slight change in the orientation of the
fixation cross) throughout each run to facilitate stable fixation and to help
maintain their attention at the center of the display. The fixation cross changed
at random time points (on average once every 1 s), independent of the
flickering stimulus presentation.
The study with additional frequency and contrast conditions was similar to
the primary study, except for the sampling of more temporal frequency (5, 15
and 30 Hz) and contrast conditions (25%, 50% and 100%). For each
condition, stimuli were presented in a block design comprised of a 12-s probe
followed by 12 s of uniform background, with the order of different conditions
randomized across runs. The participants were asked to do the same demanding fixation task as in the primary study (detecting a slight change in the
orientation of the fixation cross) throughout each run to facilitate stable
fixation and to help maintain their attention at the center of the display.
Red-green isoluminance. Flicker photometry was used to select the isoluminant
red and green stimuli for the chromatic flicker. Observers viewed a 3.51 circular
patch with alternating red and green colors in the scanner before the fMRI
experiment. The two colors were counterphase-modulated at 30 Hz, a frequency
too fast for observers to track the color alternation. With the contrast of red
color fixed, the red/green alternation generally appeared as achromatic flicker,
but each observer could adjust the contrast of green color so that no flicker
could be detected. Observers were instructed to make settings in both directions:
gradually increasing the green color contrast or gradually decreasing it.
2AFC flicker detection and 4AFC stimulus discrimination. Because the
interpretation of the study depends critically on the 30-Hz chromatic flicker
being truly fused and perceptually identical to the control conditions, we also
tested flicker detection in a criterion-free manner. All participants underwent a
2AFC experiment in separate sessions in the scanner after the fMRI experiment.
The experimental situation (contrast, luminance, viewing angle, etc.) was exactly
the same as the functional imaging experiments. For each trial in the 2AFC
experiments, there were two successive temporal intervals (2 s each, with a
500-ms blank gap between them). The 30-Hz full contrast flicker, the 5-Hz
subthreshold flicker or the matched static control stimulus were presented
randomly in the first or the second interval, and one of the others was presented
in the other interval. Observers pressed one of two buttons to indicate which
interval (the first or the second) had the flickering stimulus. All observers
performed at chance level for all of the comparisons (30-Hz full contrast flicker
with static control stimulus, 5-Hz subthreshold flicker with static control
stimulus and 30-Hz full contrast flicker with 5-Hz subthreshold flicker).
Because the 2AFC results primarily supported the notion that the 30-Hz
flicker was not perceived as flickering, we performed another 4AFC test using
the spatial layout essentially identical to that used during fMRI scanning to test
perceptual equivalency between the 30-Hz chromatic flicker and the other two
control stimuli. One of the four wedges was static (or 5-Hz subthreshold flicker),
whereas the other three were the 30-Hz full contrast flicker. After each 2-s trial,
observers indicated which wedge they believed was different than the other three.
All observers performed at chance level (25%; see Supplementary Table 2).
fMRI data acquisition and analysis. MRI data were collected on a 3T Siemens
Trio outfitted with an 8-channel phase-array coil. Echoplanar data were acquired
with standard parameters (28 axial slices, 3.0 mm thick; field of view, 220  220
mm2
; matrix, 64  64; repetition time, TR, 2,000 ms; echo time, TE, 30 ms; flip
angle, 751). The first four volumes were discarded to allow for magnetization
equilibration. A T1 weighted anatomical volume (3D MPRAGE; 1  1  1 mm3
resolution) was acquired for localization and visualization of the functional data.
After motion correction (SPM99, http://www.fil.ion.ucl.ac.uk/spm), the
functional data were coregistered with the anatomical scan using BrainVoyager

QX (Brain Innovation). After regions of interest (ROIs) were defined, time
courses from each ROI were extracted and imported into Matlab for further
analyses. For each scan, we averaged the signal intensity across trials for each
condition at each of 11 time points (from –2 s to 18 s). These time courses for
each condition were then averaged across scans. The BOLD signal (flickering
wedges minus static wedges) was calculated using average signals between 8 and
12 s in each time course (condition) for each subject, as the signal usually took
6–8 s to rise to the full magnitude.
