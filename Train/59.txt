The prefrontal cortex (PFC) plays an important role in cognitive
processes, including access to consciousness. The PFC receives significant cholinergic innervation and nicotinic acetylcholine receptors
(nAChRs) contribute greatly to the effects of acetylcholine signaling.
Using in vivo two-photon imaging of both awake and anesthetized
mice, we recorded spontaneous, ongoing neuronal activity in layer II/III
in the PFC of WT mice and mice deleted for different nAChR subunits.
As in humans, this activity is characterized by synchronous ultraslow
fluctuations and neuronal synchronicity is disrupted by light general
anesthesia. Both the α7 and β2 nAChR subunits play an important
role in the generation of ultraslow fluctuations that occur to a different extent during quiet wakefulness and light general anesthesia. The
β2 subunit is specifically required for synchronized activity patterns.
Furthermore, chronic application of mecamylamine, an antagonist of
nAChRs, disrupts the generation of ultraslow fluctuations. Our findings provide new insight into the ongoing spontaneous activity in the
awake and anesthetized state, and the role of cholinergic neurotransmission in the orchestration of cognitive functions.

prefrontal cortex
The prefrontal cortex (PFC) plays an important role in cognitive
processes such as attention (1), working memory (2), decision
making (3), social behavior (4), and emotions (5). Current theories
consider the PFC a key player in conscious processing (6–8). Deficits in prefrontal function, including attention, are noted in several
neuropsychiatric disorders, including schizophrenia, attention deficit/
hyperactivity syndrome, addiction, depression, and autism (9).
In humans, as in rodent models, cholinergic innervation of the
PFC regulates cognitive processes and neuronal activity. For example, in rodents, removing PFC cholinergic innervation reduces
attention performance, whereas stimulation of cholinergic projections causes enhancement (10). Many studies in both animal
models and humans have shown that nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (nAChRs) are of particular importance for cognitive
functions, reward, aging, and for pathologies like Alzheimer’s
Disease (11). For example, deletion of the α7 and β2 nAChR
subunits in mice impairs behaviors, such as exploration and attention (12–16). Importantly, lesions of the prelimbic cortex (PrLC)
in WT mice cause deficits in social behavior, similar to those observed in β2 knock-out (KO) mice, whereas re-expression of the β2
subunit in the PrLC of β2 KO mice rescues their social interaction
(4). Similarly, re-expression of β2 subunits in the PrLC of β2 KO
mice fully restored their attentional performance in the five-choice
serial reaction time task (16).
Ongoing spontaneous activity is known to occur in developing
and adult brain and its physiological importance has been emphasized (17). Recordings in humans indicate that ongoing activity
constantly fluctuates in a tightly correlated manner across distant
brain regions, forming reproducible patterns with rich temporal
dynamics and spatial organization (18). The potential contribution
of spontaneous activity to conscious processing has been suggested
and simulations helped characterize two main modes of activity:
an active mode characterized by rapid and sustained activity
(“ignition”) (19), which contributes to the signature of “conscious
access,” and a resting mode with spontaneous ultraslow (<0.1 Hz)
fluctuations (USFs) (18). It has been suggested that ignition and
ultraslow spontaneous fluctuations share similar mechanisms (18).
Independently, electrophysiological recordings in animal models
have distinguished “up” and “down” states (20), and the possibility
is considered here that up states coincide with USFs in humans.
Furthermore, in vivo recordings in animal models (21) reveal that,
similar to humans, USFs persist under general anesthesia, yet with
a lower amplitude (22, 23). Under anesthesia, the dominating
functional configurations have low information capacity and lack
negative correlations (24). Conversely, in the awake state a dynamic exploration of a rich, flexible repertoire of functional configurations takes place, including ignition, in the course of conscious
access. However, to our knowledge, the pharmacology and biochemistry of these processes remain unexplored.
To address this gap in our knowledge, using in vivo Ca2+ imaging we recorded and compared the spontaneous activity patterns in the PrLC of both awake mice and mice under general
anesthesia, a condition where conscious processing is known to
be altered (25). These recordings point to spontaneous and infrequent coherent states with high firing rates, analogous to
USFs. Our findings reveal a distinct role of nAChRs in the ongoing synchronous neuronal activity of the PFC in awake and
anesthetized animals, shedding light on a possible involvement of
nAChRs in conscious processing.
Significance
The human brain exhibits ongoing spontaneous activity characterized by very slow frequency fluctuations. These synchronously
firing populations are considered to play a key role in conscious
processes. We identified ultraslow fluctuations (USFs) in awake
and anesthetized mice using two-photon imaging in the prefrontal cortex, a brain region involved in cognitive processes.
Using transgenic mice, we demonstrate a crucial role for nicotinic
acetylcholine receptors (nAChRs) in the generation of ultraslow
fluctuations and their synchronicity, processes that are affected
by deletion of nAChR subunits and general anesthetics like isoflurane. This work allows further dissection of the underlying
mechanisms, and predicts that in humans with nAChR polymorphisms or copy number variation these processes might be altered, resulting in neuropsychiatric disorders.

Results
USFs Contribute to Mouse PFC Spontaneous Activity. The recognition of the “default mode” network (26) started a long-lasting
interest in the significance of the human brain’s ongoing or intrinsic activity, which is characterized by synchronous USFs of
activity, often taking seconds to develop (18). USFs have been
recorded in the cortex of awake humans and primates, and also
under anesthesia (27–30). The neuronal mechanisms that generate spontaneous resting-state fluctuations, together with the
ignition dynamics, are unknown and remain a matter of debate.
To explore these issues in vivo, we used the mouse as a model
together with two-photon imaging of spontaneous neuronal activity patterns recorded through a chronic cranial window in
layer II/III of the PrLC (Fig. S1 A and B). Neurons of the PrLC
were transduced with an adeno-associated viral vector (AAV)
expressing the fluorescent calcium indicator GCaMP6f (Materials
and Methods and SI Materials and Methods). Four weeks after
AAV injection, the majority of layer II/III neurons exhibited green
fluorescence (Fig. S1 C–E). We first studied the activity patterns of
3-mo-old awake head-fixed WT mice, where we simultaneously
monitored the spontaneously occurring somatic GCaMP6f Ca2+
transients in multiple individual cells, and estimated the neural
spiking rates through deconvolution of calcium transients (SI
Materials and Methods). The mice were awake and reactive, as
monitored by an infrared camera. A typical example of neural
population activity is shown in Fig. 1A. To identify patterns of
activity and USFs in populations of simultaneously recorded neurons, we studied the distribution of their time varying mean activity
(see Materials and Methods and SI Materials and Methods for details). In Fig. 1, the USFs correspond to population activities in red
and basal activities correspond to population activities in blue (Fig.
1 B and C). Interestingly, awake WT mice exhibited USFs with a
frequency similar to that observed in humans (below 0.1 Hz) (17,
31). These frequencies are slower than those observed in the cardiac (0.6–1.2 Hz) and respiratory cycles (0.1–0.5 Hz) (31). The
activity patterns were then analyzed to detect synchronous activity
in populations of simultaneously imaged neurons, as previously
described (20) (Materials and Methods). The number of simultaneously imaged cells ranged from 4 to 71 neurons, with a mean
value of 36 neurons (n = 2,900 cells in 7 mice). In the awake state,
we detected robust synchronicity in the neuronal populations (Fig.
1D1). Our recordings indicate that, similar to awake humans, the
ongoing activity in a mouse brain constantly fluctuates and exhibits
synchronously firing neuronal activity, making the mouse a reliable
model for studying some of the elementary physiological processes
associated with conscious processing in humans.
USFs Persist Under Light General Anesthesia, but Synchronicity Is
Disrupted. General anesthesia differentially alters states of consciousness and access to conscious content (8). The ability of
general anesthesia to induce safe and reversible loss of consciousness poses the most complex question of how a simple chemical can
affect conscious experience (32). General anesthetics may directly
or indirectly affect conscious processing by the cerebral cortex (33);
however, the neurobiological mechanisms involved in this interaction are largely unknown. We thus performed Ca2+ imaging of
mainly pyramidal cells in the PrLC of lightly anesthetized WT mice
(0.8% isoflurane), and compared their activity patterns with those
recorded in awake mice (Fig. 1 A2–D2). Interestingly, the USFs
persist under light general anesthesia, with no significant difference
between the populations that exhibit USFs in the awake state
(90.30 ± 5.03%, n = 2,900 cells in 7 mice) compared with the
anesthetized state (88.38 ± 5.82%, n = 702 cells in 3 mice;
ANOVA) (Fig. 1E). However, we observed a robust reduction of
the synchronously firing populations under anesthesia (55.87 ±
11.38%), compared with awake mice (95.35 ± 3.67, P < 0.001) (Fig.
1F). Therefore, USFs share similar mechanisms between awake
and anesthetized conditions but anesthesia shows strong inhibitory
effects on the generation of neuronal synchronicity.
Differential Role of nAChRs in the Generation of USFs and Synchronicity
in the Awake State. Many studies in both animal models and
humans have identified a contribution of nAChRs to cognitive
functions; we thus investigated the occurrence of USFs transitions in KO mice of α7 and β2 nAChR subunits. Typical examples of neuronal population activities in awake α7 and β2
KO mice are shown in Fig. 2. We found that 90.30 ± 5.03% of
simultaneously recorded populations exhibited USFs/basal activity
in WT (n = 2,900 cells in 7 mice), 82.08 ± 7.2% in α7 KO mice

(n = 1,403 cells in 5 mice), and 65.86 ± 5.7% in β2 KO mice (n =
3,459 cells in 11 mice) with a significant difference between WT
and β2 KO groups (P = 0.0130, ANOVA) (Fig. S2). In each
population of simultaneously recorded neurons with USFs/basal
activity transitions, we determined the percentage of cells that
exhibit an activity pattern in accordance with the population activity. In awake WT animals, 96.6 ± 1.8% of cells fire in accordance with their population activity, in α7 KO mice (88.23 ±
4.12%) and in β2 KO mice (84.37 ± 2.27%) (Fig. S2). To compute
the percentage of cells with USFs/basal activity for each mouse
group, we multiplied the percentage of populations with USFs/
basal activity with the mean percentage of cells in accordance with
the population patterns of activity, for each mouse. Interestingly,
we found that 82.41 ± 5.28% of simultaneously recorded cells
exhibited USFs in WT, 69.31 ± 7.4% in α7 KO mice, and 54.85 ±
5.9% in β2 KO mice, with a significant difference between WT
and β2 KO mice (P = 0.007) (Fig. 3A).
Next, we computed the USFs/basal activity properties in all populations. The basal activity duration was significantly lower for the β2
KO mice (7.36 ± 1.19 s), compared with α7 KO (11.69 ± 2.43 s, P =
0.0021) and WT mice (14.43 ± 1.54 s, P < 0.001) (Fig. 3B), whereas
the USFs duration was significantly higher for the β2 KO mice
(5.11 ± 0.64 s), compared with α7 KO (3.89 ± 0.65 s, P = 0.0022) and
WT mice (3.03 ± 0.38 s, P < 0.001, Kruskal–Wallis) (Fig. 3C).
Furthermore, computing the correlation between power spectra for
each neuronal population for the different mice conditions in the
awake state revealed that there are significantly lower correlations for
β2 KO compared with WT mice (Fig. S3). These data indicate that
the USFs of each cell in a population of simultaneously recorded
cells are more homogeneous in the case of WT and α7 KO mice
compared with β2 KO mice.
We then analyzed and compared the synchronicity in the different animal groups. In the WT and α7 KO mice, neurons displayed
strong synchronous activity in 95.35 ± 3.67% (40 populations) and
88.33 ± 11.66% (38 populations) of the recorded populations, respectively, with no significant difference between groups (P = 0.70,
ANOVA) (Fig. 3D). In the β2 KO mice, the patterns of activity
were remarkably different from that in WT (P < 0.001) and α7 KO
mice (P = 0.046), with synchronous activity detected in only 63.91 ±
5.38% of the recorded populations (99 populations) (Fig. 3D). The
number of synchrony peaks detected was similar between WT mice
(30.59 ± 3.73 peaks per minute) and α7 KO mice (31 ± 6.77 peaks
per minute, P = 0.99), whereas a robust decrease was observed in
the case of β2 KO mice (4.52 ± 0.72 peaks per minute, P < 0.001,
ANOVA) (Fig. 3E). In addition, the percentage of coactive cells in
the peaks of synchrony was significantly higher for α7 KO (53.34 ±
0.51%) and β2 KO mice (53.30 ± 1.05%) compared with the WT
mice (47.71 ± 0.47%, P < 0.001) (Fig. 3F).
Overall, USFs were still detected in mice with deleted nAChR
subunits. However, β2 KO mice showed reductions in the percentage of cells that exhibit USFs and a strong decrease in the
percentage of synchronously firing neuronal populations. These
data indicate a potentially major role for β2 subunits in the
generation of physiological phenomena associated with conscious processing in the awake state.
Role of nAChRs in Ongoing Activity Under General Anesthesia. The
nAChRs are possible direct/indirect targets of general anesthetics
and as a consequence may interfere with cholinergic transmission.
For example, the volatile anesthetic isoflurane shows high affinity for
nAChRs (34). However, isoflurane inhibition has been found to vary
with nAChR subunit composition (35). We aimed to study in vivo
the contribution of defined nAChR subunits to spontaneous activity
under conditions of light general anesthesia. Typical examples of
the effect on the neuronal population activity in α7 and β2 KO
anesthetized mice are shown in Fig. 4. We found that 88.4 ± 5.8% of

simultaneously recorded populations exhibited USFs/basal activity
in WT (n = 702 cells in 3 mice), 76.6 ± 14.5% in α7 KO (n = 389
cells in 4 mice), and 85.7 ± 4.9% in β2 KO (n = 522 cells in 4 mice),
with no significant difference between the groups (Fig. S2). Furthermore, in WT mice 96.42 ± 4.28% of cells fire in accordance with
their population activity, 91.66 ± 6.55% in α7 KO mice, and 83.82 ±
2.2% in β2 KO mice (Fig. S2).
We also found that 76.68 ± 4.35% of simultaneously recorded
cells exhibited USFs in WT mice, 65.89 ± 14.16% in α7 KO mice,
and 68.35 ± 4.3% in β2 KO mice, with no significant difference
(Fig. 5A). Next, we computed the USFs/basal activity properties
in all populations. Under anesthesia, there were no significant
changes of basal activity state duration between animal types
(P > 0.14, Kruskal–Wallis), nor any significant changes in variability (P > 0.49, Ansari–Bradley) (Fig. 5B). Conversely, the USF
duration was significantly higher for the α7 KO mice (4.19 ± 2.57 s)
and β2 KO mice (2.86 ± 0.55 s), compared with WT mice (2.11 ±
0.40 s, P < 0.001) (Fig. 5C). In addition, there were no significant
differences in the correlations of power spectra between the different mouse types in the anesthetized state (Fig. S3).
For anesthetized animals, the number of simultaneously imaged
cells in the same focal plane ranged from 3 to 96 neurons, with a
mean value of 23 neurons. Of simultaneously recorded populations,
55.87 ± 11.38% exhibited synchronous activity in WT mice (54
populations), 56.66 ± 23.33% in α7 KO mice (25 populations), and
65.41 ± 18.20% in β2 KO mice (129 populations), with no significant differences (P > 0.9) between groups (Fig. 5D). Interestingly,
in the anesthetized state, the number of synchrony peaks detected
was similar between WT mice (0.79 ± 0.16 peaks per minute) and
α7 KO mice (1.41 ± 0.52 peaks per minute), whereas a robust increase was observed in the case of β2 KO mice (4.58 ± 0.62 peaks
per minute, P < 0.001) (Fig. 5E). Finally, the percentage of coactive
cells in the peaks of synchrony was significantly higher for the WT
mice (41.03 ± 1.03%) and α7 KO mice (46.30 ± 1.25%) compared
with β2 KO mice (21.74 ± 0.19%, P < 0.001, ANOVA) (Fig. 5F).
To summarize these results, the deletion of nAChR α7 and β2
subunits has differential effects in awake mice on USFs duration,
whereas in the anesthetized state, β2 deletion alone increases
synchronicity and decreases the percentage of coactive cells in
the peaks of synchrony, compared with WT and α7 KO mice.
Chronic Exposure to Mecamylamine Mimics β2 KO Phenotype. Finally,
we aimed to compare the neuronal activity patterns in the PFC of
WT mice after chronic application of mecamylamine, a nonselective, noncompetitive antagonist of nAChRs. Osmotic minipumps for the infusion of either saline or mecamylamine (1 mg/kg
per day for mecamylamine) were implanted subcutaneously at the
nape of the neck of WT mice. We recorded the neuronal activity
patterns 7 d after minipump impantation. Typical examples of
neuronal population activities in awake mice under saline or
mecamylamine are shown in Fig. S4. We found that 94.44 ± 5.55%
of simultaneously recorded populations exhibited USFs/basal activity in WT under saline condition (n = 743 cells in 3 mice) and
69.44 ± 2.77% in WT under mecamylamine (n = 446 cells in 3
mice) with a significant difference between the two groups (P =
0.015) (Fig. S5A). In awake WT animals under saline conditions,
98.21 ± 2.4% of cells fire in accordance with their population
activity, whereas in WT under mecamylamine 90.32 ± 2.4% of cells
were in accordance (P = 0.041) (Fig. S5B). In addition, we found
that 88.91 ± 3.67% of simultaneously recorded cells exhibited
USFs in WT under saline, whereas a significant reduction was
observed for the WT mice under mecamylamine (62.28 ± 3.18%,
P = 0.0054) (Fig. 6A1). The basal activity duration was significantly
lower for the WT mice under mecamylamine (13.62 ± 3.97 s),
compared with WT under saline (17.02 ± 4.18 s, P = 0.018) (Fig.
S5C). Furthermore, USF duration was significantly higher for WT
under saline (2.90 ± 0.28 s), compared with WT under mecamylamine (1.95 ± 0.45 s, P = 0.011) (Fig. S5D).

We then analyzed and compared the synchronicity under saline
and mecamylamine infusion. In the WT mice under saline, neurons
displayed synchronous activity in 81.11 ± 11.60% of the recorded
populations, whereas in WT mice under mecamylamine 88.89 ±
11.11% of the recorded populations had synchronous activity, with
no significant difference between groups (P = 0.65) (Fig. S5E).
However, the number of synchrony peaks detected was strongly
decreased in WT mice under mecamylamine (3.27 ± 1.09 peaks per
minute) in comparison with WT mice under saline (17 ± 4.94 peaks
per minute, P = 0.036) (Fig. 6A2). In addition, the percentage of
coactive cells in the peaks of synchrony was significantly lower for
WT under mecamylamine (21.86 ± 0.80%) compared with the WT
mice under saline (28.64 ± 0.8%, P < 0.001) (Fig. S5F). Thus,
pharmacological exposure to the nicotinic antagonist mecamylamine gives a phenotype similar to that found in β2 KO mice.
Discussion
In humans, two distinct modes of electrical activation of the cerebral cortex have been recorded: a rapid and sustained activation,
termed “ignition,” which is viewed as a signature of conscious access; and synchronous USFs with low amplitude, which characterize
the spontaneous activity mode, termed “resting state” (19). In the
resting state, in the absence of explicit task performance or external
stimulus perception, the cortex exhibits a highly informative mode
of spontaneous activity. Studies in anesthetized animals (21) and in
humans with blood-oxygen level-dependent fMRI data (27), together with animal recordings of firing-rate modulations (23), and
EEG (22) and ECoG in humans (23, 36), reveal ultraslow (<0.1 Hz)
dynamic activations with low amplitude, that we termed USFs,
which may be viewed as characterizing the resting state. Here, we
aimed to elucidate the mechanisms engaged in these cortical activity dynamics at a single-cell resolution using in vivo two-photon
imaging in the mouse. We recorded ongoing spontaneous activity in
the PFC of WT and mice deleted for specific nAChR subunits, both
in awake and anesthetized states. Interestingly, we recorded USFs
in the mouse cortex and found that anesthesia shows inhibitory
effects by disrupting the synchronous USFs’ firing of neurons. We
further showed that, first, nAChRs have an important role in the
generation of USFs, yet to a different extent during quiet wakefulness and anesthesia, and that the β2 subunit is specifically required for synchronized activity patterns. Our recordings indicate
that, similar to humans, the ongoing activity in mouse brain constantly fluctuates and exhibits synchronously firing neuronal activity,
making the mouse a reliable, although simplified model, for studying
mechanisms of conscious processing in humans.
Current theories consider the PFC as a key player in conscious
processing (6). According to the Global Neuronal Workspace
(GNW) theory, a subset of cortical pyramidal cells with long-range
excitatory axons that are particularly dense in prefrontal, cingulate,
and parietal regions, together with the relevant thalamo-cortical
loops, form a horizontal “neuronal workspace” interconnecting the
multiple specialized, automatic, and nonconscious processors. A
conscious content is assumed to be encoded by the “all or none”
sustained and synchronous ignition of a fraction of GNW neurons (7,
8). In these circumstances, the nonamplified neurons would be
inhibited and the GNW sustained ignition would represent the
conscious content. In the PFC, pyramidal neurons in layer II/III do
not express nAChRs, only interneurons do, in contrast to layers V
and VI, where nAChRs are also expressed by pyramidal neurons
(37). In addition, pyramidal neurons with long axons, which have
been postulated to play a critical role in the GNW theory (38), are
more abundant in these particular layers of the cerebral cortex and
especially in the PFC (39). By recording neuronal activity patterns in
layer II/III of PFC, we found that α7 and β2 nAChRs play an important role in the generation of USFs that occur, yet to a different
extent during quiet wakefulness and anesthesia. We showed that the
balance of recurrent excitation and inhibition is disrupted in the case
of awake β2 KO mice, and more specifically, the neuronal synchronicity is disrupted. It has been reported that the β2 subunit is involved
in the dendritic morphogenesis of pyramidal neurons, and in particular, in the circuits that contribute to the high-order functional
connectivity of the cerebral cortex (40). These defects in the maturation of the cerebral cortex that have been reported in the β2 KO
mice could contribute to the observed behavioral deficits (4, 13, 16).
However, our data reveal that pharmacological intervention with
nicotinic antagonists is enough for the disruption of USF mechanisms. Our findings suggest an important contribution of nAChRs in
the processing of neural information during quiet wakefulness.
Moreover, an important role of the cholinergic innervation of
the cerebral cortex was postulated (41) to be the mediation of
arousal state. This hypothesis was based on the initial observation
that the cholinergic inputs are diffusely distributed in the cerebral
cortex and, most interestingly for us, exhibits a slow release of
ACh on the same time scale as the USFs. Several studies have
further shown that cholinergic projections to the cortex are involved in sustained attention and cue detection, with the level of
ACh efflux in the PFC correlating with the demand upon attention during attentional tasks (42). The slow fluctuations in ACh
levels correlate with a shift in behavior, indicating that these
fluctuations could correlate with decision-making (42, 43). Indeed,
experimental evidence from both rodents and humans revealed
that ACh release contributes to mechanisms that mediate the integration of external cues with internal representations to initiate
and guide behavior (44). At the scale of seconds, ACh undergoes
phasic release, which may exert a top-down control over defined
cognitive operations; muscarinic ACh receptors also play an important role in attentional behavior and cue detection (45). Recently, it has been shown in vitro that endogenously released ACh
can modulate up and down states through the activation of
nAChRs (46). The alterations of neuronal activity patterns that our
results revealed in the nAChR KO mice could further our understanding of the cholinergic system in higher brain functions and,
when disrupted, the contribution of nAChRs to cognitive disorders.
The focus of the present study was to elucidate the role of nAChRs
in PFC activity patterns when comparing resting-state dynamics in
awake and anesthetized animals. Because ongoing spontaneous
activity has been postulated to have a significant functional role in
cortical functions (47), we focused on how it differs between awake
and anesthetized states. The production of USFs was identified and
compared among the different conditions investigated. Our work
demonstrates, in vivo, that nAChRs play a crucial role in the modulation of PFC synchronous spontaneous neuronal activity. Furthermore, with recent studies probing the mechanisms of general
anesthesia as causing loss of consciousness, our work exploring the
effects of anesthesia on nAChRs in the PFC network in vivo, at a
cellular resolution, reveals an elaborate mechanism for modulating
cortical activity. Our results provide a starting point for understanding
the relationship between nAChRs and loss of consciousness under

light anesthesia in mice that might potentially be a reliable—although
highly simplified—model for studying mechanisms of conscious processing in humans. As a future goal, it is important to consider additional studies to evaluate the presence of USFs during behavioral
assays. Because several studies have shown that deletion in mice of the
α7 and β2 subunits impairs behaviors, such as exploratory behavior
and attention, it will be important to investigate the behavioral deficits
in parallel with neuronal recordings to establish a causal relationship.
Materials and Methods
Male α7 KO, β2 KO, and WT (C57BL/6J) mice used in the present study were
maintained at Charles River Laboratories (L’Arbresle, France). The experiments described in this study were conducted in accordance with the guidelines
on the ethical use of animals from the European Community Council Directive of
November 24, 1986 (86/609/EEC) and in accordance with institutional animal
welfare guidelines, and were approved by Animalerie Centrale and Médecine du
Travail, Institut Pasteur and the Institut Pasteur Ethics Committee, CETEA,
protocol numbers 2013-0056, 2013-0104, and 2015-0007.
Chronic cranial windows were performed as previously described (48) and 200 nL
of AAV.syn.GCaMP6f was injected bilaterally in the PFC. Two-photon experiments
were performed with an Ultima IV two-photon laser-scanning microscope system
(Bruker), at a frame rate of 7 Hz. For data analysis we used ImageJ software and
we developed a custom-written toolbox in MATLAB. Full methods are described in SI Materials and Methods.
