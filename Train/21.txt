Experience-driven synaptic plasticity is believed to underlie adaptive
behavior by rearranging the way neuronal circuits process information. We have previously discovered that O-GlcNAc transferase (OGT),
an enzyme that modifies protein function by attaching β–N-acetylglucosamine (GlcNAc) to serine and threonine residues of intracellular
proteins (O-GlcNAc), regulates food intake by modulating excitatory
synaptic function in neurons in the hypothalamus. However, how
OGT regulates excitatory synapse function is largely unknown. Here
we demonstrate that OGT is enriched in the postsynaptic density of
excitatory synapses. In the postsynaptic density, O-GlcNAcylation on
multiple proteins increased upon neuronal stimulation. Knockout of
the OGT gene decreased the synaptic expression of the AMPA receptor GluA2 and GluA3 subunits, but not the GluA1 subunit. The number of opposed excitatory presynaptic terminals was sharply reduced
upon postsynaptic knockout of OGT. There were also fewer and less
mature dendritic spines on OGT knockout neurons. These data identify OGT as a molecular mechanism that regulates synapse maturity.
O-GlcNAc | OGT | excitatory synapses | AMPA receptors
Neuronal synapses, the cell–cell junctions over which neurons
communicate, are formed and eliminated throughout life,
and their turnover has for decades been associated with the way
neuronal circuits adapt to environmental challenges to optimize
behavior (1, 2). In both humans and animals, early development is
characterized by massive generation of new synapses. About half of
all synapses are then lost during adolescence (2, 3). Most mature
excitatory synapses occur on dendritic protrusions called spines
and essentially all spines contain an excitatory synapse (4–6). In
vivo imaging of individual spines for days to months has shown that
adult spines are largely stable but a small subpopulation remains
plastic (3, 7) and spine turnover is increased by novel experience
(5, 8–10). Whereas most new spines are thin and withdraw rapidly,
some enlarge and form stable synaptic contacts (2, 3, 7, 11–14). In
fact, the stabilization of a subset of new spines correlates with
behavioral performance in several different tasks in multiple animal species (13, 15–17). Rather than synapse formation or density,
the selection of which spines are retained once formed has been
suggested to match circuit architecture with behavior (18). Without
affecting spine formation, deleting β-adducin, which regulates actin, perturbed the process by which nascent spines establish functional synapses and impaired long-term memory (19). Fragile X
syndrome, a common form of mental retardation, exhibits a higher
than normal density of spines but more of them exhibit an immature morphology and their turnover is not affected by sensory
experience (9, 20). Conversely, the protein Telencephalin arrests
the maturation of spines and its removal enhances several forms of
learning (13, 21, 22).
Although many molecules have been identified that affect synapse number, it is unclear how newly formed spines mature into
synapses (13, 23, 24). On a cellular level, learning and memory are
associated with long-term potentiation (LTP) and long-term depression (LTD) of neurotransmission. It is widely believed that
LTP and LTD involve synaptic insertion and removal, respectively,
of α-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionic acid (AMPA)
receptors (25). AMPA receptors are glutamate-gated tetrameric
ion channels composed of different combinations of subunits
GluA1–4 and conduct the majority of the fast excitatory neurotransmission in the brain (26). Spines have been reported to incorporate AMPA receptors early in their development (13, 27, 28).
Apart from additional roles in long-lasting synapses, AMPA receptor activity has been associated with the stabilization of immature spines, possibly, at least in part, via actin-dependent pathways
(4, 14, 29–35).
In neurons, the O-GlcNAc pathway has emerged recently as
critical for coupling cellular function to energy availability through
nutrient-dependent flux via the hexosamine biosynthesis pathway
(HBP), of which the OGT donor substrate uridine diphosphate
(UDP)-GlcNAc is the end product (36–40). Unlike complex glycans present on the outside of cells and in the secretory pathway,
O-GlcNAc is a highly dynamic sugar that is added and removed
repeatedly over the lifespan of a single peptide chain. It is
expressed mainly on the inside of cells in the nucleus, cytoplasm,
and mitochondria. Only two enzymes regulate its cycling;
O-GlcNAc transferase (OGT) attaches O-GlcNAc to proteins
covalently, whereas O-GlcNAcase (OGA) hydrolyses O-GlcNAc
from proteins. The brain is one of the organs where O-GlcNAc is
the most abundant (39, 41–43). In the synapse, a myriad of
proteins carry O-GlcNAc (44–46). Many of these are critical for
synaptic plasticity, like alpha calcium/calmodulin-dependent kinase II (αCaMKII) and SynGAP (46, 47). O-GlcNAc signaling
does affect learning and memory (48, 49). Acute inhibition of
OGT or OGA pharmacologically, indicated that O-GlcNAc regulates LTP and LTD by affecting AMPA receptor trafficking.
However, there have been contradictory reports of whether global
elevation or depression of O-GlcNAc levels have a stimulatory
or inhibitory effect, respectively, on excitatory synaptic function,
possibly due to nonspecific effects of OGT inhibitors or differences in mode and length of application of drugs against OGA
Significance
Neurons in the brain adapt to environmental challenges by
rearranging their connections, or synapses, to other neurons.
This process is called synaptic plasticity and it is unclear how
synaptic plasticity is regulated. Here we show that the enzyme
O-GlcNAc transferase (OGT) modulates the maturity of excitatory synapses. The function of OGT depends on the metabolic
status of the cell and the body. Previously, OGT has been linked
to appetitive behavior, learning and memory, and neurodegenerative diseases like Alzheimer’s disease. Our data suggest
that OGT may underlie brain function by coordinating experience-driven synaptic plasticity with nutrient availability.

(49–51). We developed a mouse model where OGT was deleted
genetically from mature brain neurons in vivo and demonstrated
that OGT regulates normal food intake, at least in part, by modulating excitatory synaptic function in neurons in the hypothalamus
(36). Using electrophysiology, we observed that knocking out OGT
sharply reduced the frequency of miniature excitatory postsynaptic
currents (mEPSCs). mEPSC amplitude was also decreased, but to a
lesser degree. These findings indicate that OGT can underlie
adaptive behavior partly by regulating normal excitatory synaptic
function (36).
Here we investigate how OGT regulates excitatory synaptic
function by taking advantage of primary neuronal cell culture
where OGT is deleted genetically either broadly or sparsely in
neurons. We discovered that OGT deletion selectively reduced
the synaptic expression of the GluA2 and GluA3 subunits, two
major AMPA receptor subunits. Mimicking our electrophysiological finding of lower mEPSC frequency in vivo, removal of
OGT in vitro led to fewer mature morphological synapses and
fewer dendritic spines. The spines that were present on OGT KO
neurons were largely immature. Collectively, our observations
suggest that OGT is important for the maturation of excitatory
synapses, at least in part through modulating GluA2/3 expression.
The regulation of synapse maturity by OGT represents a model
for how neuronal circuits may respond to environmental challenges, such as nutrient fluctuations, to accommodate behavior.
Results
OGT Is Enriched in the Postsynaptic Density of Excitatory Synapses.
Based on biochemical fractionation, it has been shown previously
that OGT is present in neuronal synapses (45, 51). Electron
microscopy from the cerebellum indicated that OGT is more
highly expressed in presynaptic, rather than postsynaptic, nerve
terminals (44). To investigate the role of OGT in postsynaptic
function, we isolated the postsynaptic density (PSD) fraction of
excitatory synapses from rat forebrain homogenates. Equal
amounts of all fractions were separated by SDS/PAGE and analyzed by Western blotting (Wb). Enrichment of the PSD marker
PSD-95 and exclusion of the presynaptic marker synaptophysin
ensured that the PSD fraction isolated PSDs specifically (Fig. 1A).
Full-length nuclear cytoplasmic OGT (ncOGT) was present in all
subcellular compartments, including in the PSD (Fig. 1A). Interestingly, compared with the whole-cell homogenate, OGT was
more than twice as abundant in the PSD (Fig. 1B). In contrast to
OGT, OGA was excluded from the PSD (Fig. 1A). We then used
immunohistochemistry to examine the localization of OGT in
primary cultured hippocampal neurons. Along the dendrite, endogenous OGT expression was punctate and many, but not all,
puncta overlapped with PSD-95. Most PSD-95 puncta overlapped
with OGT (Fig. 1C). It has been shown that depolarization of
cultured neuroblastoma cells using KCl activates OGT via calciumdependent phosphorylation by CaMKIV (52). Moreover, induced
seizures in rodents have been reported to increase the O-GlcNAcylation of some proteins in the brain in vivo (53). However,
whether, and to what extent, neuronal firing regulates O-GlcNAc
incorporation in neuronal proteins is still unclear. Taking advantage of 2D gel electrophoresis and blotting for O-GlcNAc, we
observed that stimulating neuronal network activity in cortical
cultures by inhibiting GABAA receptors pharmacologically using
bicuculline elevated O-GlcNAcylation in the PSD on multiple
proteins (Fig. 1D). Together, our observations demonstrate that
OGT is enriched in the PSD of excitatory synapses in forebrain
neurons. Within the PSD, O-GlcNAcylation is a dynamic and activity-dependent posttranslational modification.
OGT Regulates the Synaptic Expression of AMPA Receptors. Recently,
we knocked out OGT in adult animals and observed a marked
attenuation of excitatory synaptic currents using electrophysiology
(36). Other groups have shown that acute inhibition of OGT or
OGA activity affects LTP and LTD in the CA1 region of the
hippocampus, possibly through altered AMPA receptor trafficking
(49–51). Two major AMPA receptor isoforms are GluA1/2 and
GluA2/3 heteromers (26, 54). Here we deleted OGT in cortical
neurons cultured from floxed OGT mice (OGTFl) by applying
lentivirus expressing either GFP alone (WT) or GFP together with
Cre recombinase (KO) at days in vitro (DIV)2. After the neurons
had matured, we isolated the cell surface proteins using biotinylation techniques and blotted for the major AMPA receptor
subunits. As shown in Fig. 2A, only proteins expressed on the
surface of the cell were pulled down applying this method. There
was no change in the total expression of PSD-95 upon deleting
OGT (Fig. 2 A and B). In contrast, removal of OGT caused a
sharp down-regulation of the surface expression of the GluA2 and
the GluA3 AMPA receptor subunits but not the GluA1 subunit
(Fig. 2 A and C). The total expression of GluA2 and GluA3 was
also decreased (Fig. 2 A and B). There was no effect on the relative surface over total expression of either subunit, although
there was a trend toward a small decrease for GluA1 (P = 0.05,
n = 6 for WT and KO, Fig. 2D). We also isolated the PSD from
OGT WT and KO cultures. In the PSD, there was a reduction in
GluA3, whereas there was an increase in GluA1 (Fig. 2 E and F).
The decrease in GluA2, again, was at a level between GluA1 and
GluA3 (9% decrease, P = 0.08, Fig. 2 E and F). Next, we sparsely
knocked out OGT in hippocampal cultures from OGTFl mice by
transfecting a cell-fill (GFP) and an empty plasmid (WT) or a
plasmid expressing Cre (KO) around DIV9. At DIV14, we used
immunohistochemistry to stain the surface GluA2 population using
an antibody directed against its N terminus and, after permeabilization, the total GluA2/3 population with a C terminustargeted antibody. There was no overt difference in the overall

morphology between WT and KO neurons (Fig. 3A). In the soma,
the total GluA2/3 expression did not change upon OGT KO (Fig.
3B). In contrast, along dendrites, similar to what we showed biochemically, the number of surface GluA2 positive puncta decreased by 51% (P < 0.05, WT n = 27, 4.9 ± 0.5 puncta/10 μm; KO
n = 28, 2.4 ± 0.2 puncta/10 μm, Fig. 3 C and D). Similarly, the
number of total GluA2/3 puncta was 51% lower in OGT KO
neurons (P < 0.05, WT n = 27, 5.4 ± 1.1 puncta/10 μm; KO n = 28,
2.7 ± 0.69 puncta/10 μm, Fig. 3 C and E). This change in expression was not reflected in the size of the surface GluA2 puncta
and the size of the GluA2/3 puncta was only slightly smaller (Fig. 3
C, F, and G). Using biochemistry and imaging, our results indicate
that OGT is necessary cell autonomously for normal synaptic expression of AMPA receptors, in particular the GluA2/
3 heteromers.
Postsynaptic Deletion of OGT Leads to Fewer Morphological Synapses.
As deletion of OGT mainly affected the number of GluA2 puncta
along dendrites rather than the somatic expression of GluA2/3 or
the expression of surface GluA2 per puncta, we reasoned that
OGT may regulate the number of synaptic contacts. This idea
would be consistent with our previous electrophysiological data
showing that OGT removal primarily leads to lower mEPSC frequency (36). After sparsely deleting OGT and labeling cells in
hippocampal cultures as described above, immunohistochemistry
was applied to stain for vGlut1, a marker for excitatory presynaptic
terminals, and PSD-95 (Fig. 4A). The number of puncta and the
size of each puncta overlapping with the cell fill was then quantified. Both the number PSD-95 and vGlut1 positive puncta decreased (Fig. 4 A, B, and D). In contrast, neither the size of the
PSD-95 nor the vGlut1 puncta differed between WT and KOs
(Fig. 4 C and E). Together, our data suggest that deleting OGT in
the postsynaptic cell prevents the formation of morphologically
mature synapses. These observations corroborate and expand the
previous finding that the drop in mEPSC frequency upon OGT
KO in vivo reflects a loss of functional synapses (36).
OGT Removal Is Associated with Deficient Spine Maturation. Most
excitatory synapses occur on dendritic spines (2). Filling the neuron
with a fluorescent marker, spines can be imaged and their number
and shape measured. Whereas the number of spines is a function
of the number of excitatory synapses, the shape of the spine indicates its maturity (4–6). Mature and stable spines typically exhibit a
wider distal portion (“spine head”) (Fig. 5A) (2, 3, 11–14, 29).
Here, again, hippocampal cultures from OGTFl mice were sparsely
transfected to label cells and KO OGT at DIV9 and then fixed at
DIV14. Upon deletion of OGT, spine number decreased by 43%
(P < 0.05; WT n = 26, 3.9 ± 0.3 spines/10 μm; KO n = 28, 2.2 ± 0.2
spines/10 μm, Fig. 5 A and B). Spine shape was measured by
quantifying the ratio between the width and the length of individual
spines (Fig. 5A). Counting all spines, deleting OGT decreased their
mean shape ratio by 33% (P < 0.05, WT n = 1108, 0.85 ± 0.02, KO
n = 1074, 0.57 ± 0.01, Fig. 5C). To evaluate the proportion of
mature versus immature spines, spines with a ratio above 0.5 were
labeled “mature” and those with a ratio below 0.5 “thin” (Fig. 5A).
In WT cells, the majority of all spines were mature (Fig. 5D). Of
those spines that were present on OGT KO cells, in contrast, most
were thin (Fig. 5D). To summarize, deleting OGT leads to a higher
proportion of immature spines and fewer spines in total (Fig. 5E).
Discussion
Neuronal circuits need to constantly rearrange their connectivity
pattern to match behavioral output to environmental influences.
Here we find that OGT, a nutrient-dependent enzyme, is enriched

in the postsynaptic density of excitatory synapses. In the PSD, the
incorporation of O-GlcNAc was dynamic and dependent on neuronal activation. Deletion of OGT greatly depressed the synaptic
abundance of the GluA2 and GluA3 subunits of the AMPA receptor. The reduction in GluA2 and GluA3 was largely due to
fewer dendritic AMPA receptor clusters rather than a decrease in
the amount of AMPA receptors in each cluster, indicating that the
main effect of OGT removal is due to a down-regulation of the
number of functional excitatory synapses. Indeed, removing OGT
postsynaptically disrupted the formation of synapses, as determined
by staining of the synaptic vesicle protein vGlut1 and the postsynaptic marker PSD-95. There were also fewer spines on OGT KO
neurons. Those spines that did form were mostly immature and did
not express morphological features reminiscent of stable synapses.
Total spine number is regulated by the formation of new spines
and the termination of old spines. We deleted OGT genetically
before or during the period of the most extensive synapse formation in culture (DIV7–14) and observed a marked reduction in
spine density. Accordingly, although we have not applied methods
such as live imaging of individual spine turnover to verify this idea,
it is likely that the decrease in total spine number upon OGT KO
mainly resulted from disrupted spine formation. In the PSD of
OGT KO cells, there was a comparatively high abundance of
GluA1-containing receptors, whereas GluA3-containing receptors
were lower in abundance than in WT cells. Similarly, on the cell
surface, there was a reduction in GluA2 and GluA3 but not
GluA1. As GluA2 consistently expressed at levels between GluA1
and GluA3 upon removal of OGT, the main effect of deleting
OGT presumably occurs on GluA2/3 heteromers as opposed to on
GluA1/2 heteromers. Whether, and, if so, how the roles of GluA2/3
heteromers and GluA1/2 heteromers differ have been debated in
the literature. Some evidence shows that synaptic insertion of
GluA1 homomers and GluA1/2 heteromers require neuronal
stimulation, whereas GluA2/3 heteromers have been proposed to
be inserted under baseline conditions in exchange for preexisting
receptors (55, 56). Early in development, GluA4 translocates into
so-called silent synapses and are later replaced by GluA2-containing receptors (57–59). Unlike GluA2, GluA1 does appear to
enter into silent synapses (55). Sensory experience and learning
increase the abundance of GluA1 homomers in the synapse, but
this increase is often transient (56, 60, 61). Although the trafficking
of GluA2/3 can be regulated by neuronal activity, these and other
data suggest that GluA2/3 heteromers, as opposed to GluA1
homomers or GluA1/2 heteromers, may be associated with the
maintenance of synaptic strength in mature synapses (25, 26).
Whereas total spine number was reduced, spines did develop on
OGT KO cells. But of those spines that formed, most resembled

NEUROSCIENCE
immature spines and rarely evolved morphology similar to mature
spines with a wider spine head as in WT cells. Spine formation is
intimately linked to synapse formation (2, 3, 11–14). The formation
of morphological synapses on dendrites where OGT had been
deleted, as determined by staining of vGlut1 and PSD-95, was
interrupted. Based on the selective effect on GluA2/3 heteromers,
immature spine phenotype and reduction in the number of vGlut1
and PSD-95 puncta, it appears that OGT is necessary for late,
rather than early, stages of postsynaptic development when unstable spines mature into functional synapses (Fig. 5E).
Although the experiments presented in this paper were performed in the context of synapse formation in culture, previously
we have observed a similar decrease in excitatory synapse number
in adult animals. After OGT was removed acutely in vivo, there
was a sharp drop in mEPSC frequency (36). In addition, other
groups have shown that short-term nutritional or pharmacological
manipulation of global O-GlcNAc levels in hippocampal slices
affects long-term potentiation and long-term depression of excitatory CA1 synapses (49–51). At least some of these effects may be
related to altered trafficking of GluA2 (49, 50). Collectively, these
observations suggest that OGT is important not only for the formation of new excitatory synapses during development but also for
the stability of excitatory synapses in the adult. As discussed above,
spines undergo constant remodeling where activity-dependent
signaling through AMPA receptors, e.g., via actin, maintain their
stability. Thus, it is possible that the synaptic depression of GluA2/3
heteromers upon OGT deletion prevented the development of thin
spines into mature synapses. The idea that OGT underlies spine
maturity via maintaining AMPA receptor expression would explain
why removing OGT during development and in adult animals lead
to the same phenotype; loss of excitatory synapse number. However, it cannot be excluded that OGT has a direct effect on spine
assembly as well.
OGT may regulate AMPA receptor expression through several
pathways. We show here that the O-GlcNAc content in the PSD is
dynamic. We also observed that OGT is enriched in the PSD.
Global and long-term deletion of OGT decreased the total expression of GluA2/3. In contrast, shorter and sparse OGT KO did
not affect the somatic expression of GluA2/3. This observation
indicates that OGT regulates AMPA receptor expression by a cellautonomous mechanism, probably, at least in part, through
degradation or trafficking of the receptor, which is supported by
the fact that the effect of acute manipulation of global OGlcNAc levels on excitatory neurotransmission is GluA2 dependent (49). Moreover, we and others have shown that OGlcNAc regulates excitatory synapse function in hypothalamic,
cortical, and hippocampal cells. Thus, the manipulation of synaptic AMPA receptor abundance may be a common and major
endpoint for how OGT shapes neuronal circuits. Many OGlcNAc–modified proteins known to affect AMPA receptor
trafficking have been identified using mass spectrometry, e.g.,
SynGAP and αCaMKII (46, 47). Based on these observations, it
is likely that OGT may regulate AMPA receptor expression via
pathways local to the spine or the postsynaptic density, but other
mechanisms cannot be excluded.
O-GlcNAc is increasingly being appreciated as an important
modification of protein function. Its unique regulation where
metabolic and other stimuli can affect O-GlcNAcylation on a
global as well as a target-specific scale presents a mechanism for
how cells respond to environmental challenges. Here we demonstrate that OGT is enriched in the postsynaptic density of excitatory synapses and is necessary for synapse maturation, possibly
via regulating the synaptic expression and/or localization of
GluA2/3 heteromers. O-GlcNAc cycling in the brain is linked to
learning and memory, feeding behavior, and neurodegenerative
diseases (39, 48, 49). Whereas many proteins in the excitatory
postsynaptic density are known to be modified by O-GlcNAc, an
important task will be to identify which O-GlcNAc sites are dynamically regulated to modify neuronal circuit function.
Methods
All animals were housed according to the Johns Hopkins University Animal
Care and Use Committee guidelines. Primary neuronal cell cultures from WT
animals or animals where an exon in the Ogt locus has been floxed (OGTFl)
were derived according to standard procedures. To delete OGT, a vector
expressing Cre recombinase was delivered virally (for biochemistry experiments) or by transfection (for imaging experiments). Surface proteins were
pulled down by surface biotinylation. The PSD was isolated by a series of
centrifugation steps. See SI Methods for extended details.
