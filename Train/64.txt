A half-century of research on the consequences of monocular
deprivation (MD) in animals has revealed a great deal about the
pathophysiology of amblyopia. MD initiates synaptic changes in
the visual cortex that reduce acuity and binocular vision by causing
neurons to lose responsiveness to the deprived eye. However, much
less is known about how deprivation-induced synaptic modifications
can be reversed to restore normal visual function. One theoretically motivated hypothesis is that a period of inactivity can reduce
the threshold for synaptic potentiation such that subsequent
visual experience promotes synaptic strengthening and increased
responsiveness in the visual cortex. Here we have reduced this
idea to practice in two species. In young mice, we show that the
otherwise stable loss of cortical responsiveness caused by MD is
reversed when binocular visual experience follows temporary
anesthetic inactivation of the retinas. In 3-mo-old kittens, we show
that a severe impairment of visual acuity is also fully reversed by
binocular experience following treatment and, further, that prolonged retinal inactivation alone can erase anatomical consequences of MD. We conclude that temporary retinal inactivation
represents a highly efficacious means to promote recovery of function.
ocular dominance plasticity | metaplasticity | amblyopia | visual cortex |
lateral geniculate nucleus
Amblyopia is a widespread form of human visual disability
that arises from imbalanced visual experience in the two
eyes during infancy or early childhood. The core pathophysiological process underlying amblyopia is ocular dominance plasticity in the primary visual cortex (V1). Ocular dominance
plasticity, evolutionarily conserved in mammals with binocular
vision, has become a classic paradigm for studying how brain
development is influenced by experience and deprivation. A
brief period of monocular deprivation (MD) during early postnatal life causes functional depression of synapses in V1 that
serve the deprived eye (1–7). Consequently, early-life MD severely and persistently degrades visual acuity through the deprived eye, which typically fails to recover spontaneously when
binocular vision is restored (8–10). A critical step in developing targeted interventions for treating amblyopia is to identify
strategies for reversing deprivation-driven synaptic modifications
in V1.
The traditional approach to promote recovery following MD
has been to occlude the strong eye to force vision through the
weak amblyopic eye. This “reverse occlusion” approach has been
validated in animals (11, 12) and represents the cornerstone of
current treatment (patching therapy) of human amblyopia (13–
16). However, this treatment has well-known limitations that
include poor compliance, potential loss of vision through the
newly patched eye, failure to recover binocular vision, and a
declining treatment efficacy with age (15, 17–21). Nevertheless,
the success of reverse occlusion strategies demonstrates that severely weakened synaptic inputs in the brain can be rejuvenated
under appropriate circumstances.
An insight into how reverse occlusion might promote recovery
came from a study in cat V1, which showed that neurons lose
responsiveness to the newly occluded eye days before gaining
responses to the newly open (amblyopic) eye (22). It is now
understood that the qualities of cortical synaptic plasticity depend on the recent history of cortical activity, a property called
metaplasticity (23). After a period of attenuated cortical activity,
the threshold for synaptic potentiation is reduced (24–26). Thus,
the period of quiescence that immediately follows initiation of
reverse occlusion lowers the threshold for synaptic potentiation,
enabling subsequent visual experience to increase synaptic effectiveness when it would have otherwise been without effect
(27). An intriguing possibility is that imposition of a period of
binocular inactivity following early MD could be sufficient to
promote visual recovery without forcing the eyes to compete.
In support of this concept, studies have shown that exposure
of adult rats and kittens to a period of continuous darkness can
prime the visual cortex for recovery from the effect of MD when
vision is restored to the deprived eye (28–30). However, available data suggest that this priming effect requires ≥10 d of
darkness, which cannot be interrupted, even briefly, by light
exposure and cannot be substituted with binocular lid closure
(31, 32). Further, work in kittens has shown that when initiated
before 10 wk of age, exposure to total darkness itself can cause
temporary visual impairment and even blindness before 7 wk of
age (33). Thus, although these results show the potential of
using insights gained from the study of synaptic plasticity to
promote recovery of function (34), application of this approach
to clinical practice presents many challenges.
Significance
Normal development of the visual cortex depends critically on
early life visual experience. In humans, a disparity in the quality
of vision between two eyes during infancy or early childhood
leads to a visual impairment called amblyopia. In animal models,
amblyopia can be induced early in life using a brief period of
monocular deprivation via eyelid closure. Here we show in two
evolutionarily divergent species that experimental amblyopia
can be rapidly corrected if binocular visual experience is restored
after temporarily silencing the retinas with a local anesthetic.
These findings point the way to an approach for clinical management of amblyopia with advantages over the current standard of care.

NEUROSCIENCE
In the current study, we set out to examine an alternative
method involving temporary anesthetic inactivation of the
retinas. For decades, researchers of visual system development have used tetrodotoxin (TTX) to investigate the consequences of blocking action potentials in retinal ganglion
cells. A single dose, administered by microinjection into the
vitreous humor, can locally block all impulse activity in the
optic nerve for a day or two. Of significance, inactivation of
one eye with TTX fails to trigger depression of deprived-eye
responses in V1 that is observed after comparable periods of
monocular deprivation by lid closure or image blurring (5, 7,
35–37). Thus, brief inactivation of both eyes with TTX could
potentially augment recovery of function by lowering the plasticity threshold without the liability associated with other forms
of deprivation. Furthermore, because the retinas are silent until
the drug wears off, compliance is assured.
To test this hypothesis, we performed parallel studies in
mice and kittens. Our interest in mice was driven by the utility
of this species for mechanistic studies. Although the immediate effects of MD in mice have been well documented, less
was known about the stability of these effects. Therefore, we
first conducted a longitudinal electrophysiological study to
track V1 responsiveness to stimulation of the two eyes in
awake mice for several weeks following early-life MD. We
found that 7 d of MD drove a profound reduction in visual
cortical responsiveness to deprived eye vision that persisted
through adulthood, validating this species as a model to study
the pathophysiology of amblyopia. We then investigated the
effect of bilateral retinal inactivation and observed a complete recovery from the effect of MD once binocular visual
experience was restored. We also studied treatment effectiveness in the cat, which for decades has been the preferred
species to study the effects of MD on visual system physiology, anatomy, and behavior. We found that bilateral retinal
inactivation followed by a short period of binocular visual
experience promoted fast recovery of the visual acuity of the
deprived eye to normal levels. Further, we discovered that
even in the absence of subsequent visual experience, prolonged TTX treatment led to recovery from the anatomical
consequences of MD on the visual thalamus of kittens. Our
experiments demonstrate, in two species, that temporary retinal
inactivation is an effective strategy for promoting rapid recovery
from MD-driven visual impairments.
Results
Monocular Deprivation Drives Lasting Visual Impairment in Mice.
Mice are commonly used for mechanistic studies of ocular
dominance plasticity in response to early-life MD (3, 5, 38).
Recent investigations have focused on the mechanisms responsible for the loss of responsiveness to the deprived eye (39,
40), but very little is known about the stability of these changes
or whether they can be reversed. To address these questions,
we chronically recorded visual evoked potentials (VEPs) in
thalamo-recipient layer 4 of binocular V1 over the course of
several weeks in three cohorts of mice (Fig. 1). One group had
normal visual experience; the second was monocularly deprived
by eyelid closure from postnatal day (P) 26 to P33 followed by
normal binocular visual experience; and the third group was
treated as the second except that the period of MD was followed
by a single dose of TTX injected into the vitreous humor of both
eyes (Fig. 1 A–C). TTX is a long-lasting voltage-gated sodium
channel blocker, and in agreement with previous studies (7, 41),
we found that a single dose completely abolished visual responses for 24–48 h, followed by a gradual recovery. In all MD
cases, VEPs were recorded from V1 contralateral to the deprived eye (Fig. 1A).
In agreement with previous reports (5, 42), 7-d MD drove a
profound reduction in the magnitude of VEPs during presentation of phase-reversing sinusoidal grating stimuli to the deprived eye [Fig. 1D, Center; P = 0.0006; 0.2 cycles per degree
(cpd)]. Further, we found that deprived-eye VEP magnitude
remained significantly reduced after 1 wk and 1 mo of binocular visual experience following MD, compared with pre-MD
baseline values (Fig. 1D, Center; 1 wk: P = 0.0246; 1 mo: P =
0.0023) and to sham littermate controls (Fig. 1D, Left; 1 wk:
P = 0.0020; 1 mo: P = 0.0204). The sustained depression of
deprived-eye responses was also observed at lower and higher
spatial frequencies (Fig. S1). These results demonstrate that
the visual deficit observed after 7 d of MD is long lasting and further
validate the mouse as a useful animal model of amblyopia.
Temporary Retinal Inactivation Promotes Electrophysiological
Recovery in Amblyopic Mice. After confirming depression of deprived-eye VEP magnitude immediately following 7-d MD (Fig.
1D, Right; P = 0.0099; 0.2 cpd), a cohort of mice received a
binocular intravitreal TTX injection, eliminating retinal activity
for ∼2 d, followed by normal binocular experience. Subsequent
VEP recordings revealed responses to the deprived eye that
actually exceeded baseline values 1 wk later (P = 0.0562) and
were no different from baseline 1 mo later (P = 0.9454). Visually
evoked responses in animals that experienced binocular inactivation following MD were significantly increased over littermates that experienced MD only (Fig. 1 D and E; 1 wk: P <
0.0001; 1 mo: P = 0.0028) and were statistically indistinguishable
from sham littermate controls that had no MD (1 wk: P = 0.6442;
1 mo: P = 0.7981). Assessment of VEPs measured with lower and
higher spatial frequency stimuli (0.05 and 0.4 cpd, respectively)
revealed similar trends, although recovery for the higher spatial
frequency was not observed immediately, but instead occurred
between 1 wk and 1 mo following the injection (Fig. S1). Meanwhile, binocular inactivation had no lasting impact on nondeprived
eye responses (Fig. 1E and Fig. S1). Thus, whereas early-life MD
in mice can drive a sustained deficit in V1 responsiveness to vision
through the deprived eye, this deficit can be eliminated following
binocular retinal inactivation.
Temporary Retinal Inactivation Restores Visual Acuity in Amblyopic
Kittens. Although mice are useful for mechanistic studies of
amblyopia, the species with the longest history and richest
database is the cat. Advantages of the cat include visual
pathways that share a similar organization to those of primates, good visual acuity, stereoscopic vision, and functional
and morphological responses to early MD that are very large
and similar to those observed in primates. The lineage of
modern cats and mice diverged early in mammalian evolution,
even before the divarication of rodents and primates (43). A
similar response to treatment in cats and mice would thus be
consistent with evolutionary conservation of a common mechanism that might apply generally to visual mammals, including
humans.
Visual acuity was measured in kittens using a two-alternative
forced-choice discrimination task (30, 44) (Fig. 2A). Consistent
with previous studies, we found that 7-d MD initiated at P30
induced a long-lasting deficit in deprived-eye visual acuity (Fig. 2
B–D). In our first pilot experiment (animal C349) we injected the
eyes with two doses of TTX 2 d apart, starting on P99, ∼2 mo
after the deprived eye had been opened (Fig. 2B). Remarkably,
within 1 wk of the return of normal acuity in the nondeprived eye
(reflecting clearance of the TTX), we observed a rapid and
complete recovery from amblyopia in the fellow deprived eye. To
confirm this encouraging result, we repeated the experiment in
three littermates using a similar experimental design (Fig. 2C).
Assessed with the pupillary light reflex and visual placement
behavior, it appeared that blockade of retinal activity lasted ∼5 d,
with full restoration of vision through the nondeprived eye
apparent 10 d after the first TTX dose. Over the next 10 d,
acuity in the deprived (amblyopic) eyes of all three additional
kittens increased until it was indistinguishable from that of the
nondeprived eye.
In a fifth kitten (C362) we attempted to investigate the
effect of a single binocular dose of TTX at P94 (Fig. 2D). Unfortunately, although visuomotor behavior was affected by the
14140 | www.pnas.org/cgi/doi/10.1073/pnas.1613279113 Fong et al.
treatment, the kitten showed incomplete pupil dilation as well as
weak light reflexes and visual placing responses. The animal’s
impairment on the behavioral task indicated that retinal activity
was at least partially disrupted, although the sustained visual
reflexes suggested that activity blockade was incomplete. Interestingly, we also failed to observe any recovery of acuity in the
deprived eye, suggesting that a partial activity blockade is insufficient for promoting visual recovery. We attempted a second
TTX injection, 1.5 mo after the initial injection. This time, the
treatment successfully blocked visual reflexes (indicative of a
complete retinal activity blockade) in both eyes, and we observed
a full recovery of acuity in the deprived eye over the next 2 wk
(Fig. 2D). Together, these data suggest that complete blockade
of retinal spiking is required to promote visual recovery, and
that a single administration of an inactivating agent can promote normal visual acuity even several months after MD.
Sustained Retinal Inactivation Drives Anatomical Recovery from
Consequences of MD in Kittens. In cats as in monkeys, substantial
shrinkage of neurons occurs in the layers of the lateral geniculate
nucleus (LGN) that relay information to V1 from the deprived
eye. Shrinkage of these neurons correlates well with the loss of
their axonal arbors and synaptic influence in V1 (45–48). Thus,
assessment of LGN cell-size changes after MD ± TTX has the
potential to provide additional insight into how the treatment
promotes recovery. We found that 7-d MD produced a clear
deprivation effect (expressed as the percent difference in cell size
between deprived and nondeprived LGN layers) (48) (Fig. 3 A
and D), which was still apparent in animals receiving 2–3 doses of
TTX every 2 d immediately following MD (Fig. 3D). This finding
indicates that brief binocular activity blockade itself does not
restore function to deprived-eye cortical inputs, but possibly
primes the cortex for recovery when the TTX wears off and
binocular vision is provided. However, we also found that with
five binocular doses over 10 d, soma sizes in deprived layers of
LGN returned to normal and the deprivation effect was eliminated (Fig. 3 B, D, and E). This striking finding contrasts with the
effect of treating only the deprived eye with TTX, which further
exacerbated the deprivation effect (Fig. 3 C and E). Thus, some
aspects of recovery are experience independent, as they occur
during the period of retinal inactivation and presumably provide a
scaffold for visual recovery that ensues with subsequent binocular
vision.
Discussion
Our experiments reveal that stable electrophysiological, anatomical, and behavioral consequences of early-life MD can be
fully and rapidly reversed in two evolutionarily distant species,
kittens and mice, when binocular visual experience is restored
following temporary bilateral anesthetic inactivation of the retinas. These findings suggest the possibility of developing a treatment modality for amblyopia with significant advantages over the
current standard of care.
Kittens historically have been a preferred animal model to
study ocular dominance plasticity, in part because of clear
relevance of the findings to human amblyopia. As is the case in
humans and nonhuman primates, MD and reverse occlusion
are effective in kittens only during a well-defined sensitive
period of early postnatal development; the physiological and
anatomical changes in LGN and V1 correlate with altered
acuity and binocularity assessed behaviorally; and temporary
deprivation produces visual deficits that persist even when
normal visual experience is restored. However, over the past

20 y, mice have supplanted other species for the investigation
of visual cortical plasticity because of their numerous advantages for interventional mechanistic studies. Mice show many
of the expected responses to temporary MD, including robust
depression of deprived-eye responses. However, one unusual
feature of mouse ocular dominance plasticity is that it persists
well into adulthood (42), particularly when visual experience
is enriched (49, 50). An additional complication is that the
ocular dominance shift initiated in adults reverts spontaneously when binocular vision is restored (51, 52) or if both
eyelids are closed (53). Thus, for the mouse to serve as a
useful model for amblyopia following early-life MD, it was of
particular importance to understand the degree to which the
juvenile ocular dominance shift persists when binocular experience is restored. Previous studies in juvenile mice have
shown that deprived-eye visual deficits persist through adulthood following 13-d MD ending at P32 (10), but not 4- to 5-d
MD ending at P30 (51, 54). In our study, we monitored
spontaneous recovery following 7-d MD (P26–P33). We took
advantage of the fact that the effects of MD could be followed
in the same animals through chronically implanted electrodes
in V1. These longitudinal recordings revealed that like cats and
primates, 7-d early MD in mice depresses responses to stimulation of the deprived eye, and this response depression persists
for weeks. Whereas we did observe some evidence of spontaneous recovery during the first week after MD (Fig. S1B), deprived-eye responses in MD animals were still well below sham
controls. These findings establish 7 d of early MD in mice as a
useful protocol to investigate strategies for reversing ocular
dominance plasticity and promoting recovery from amblyopia.
It has been known for many years from work in kittens and
monkeys that deprivation-induced synaptic depression can be
reversed if normal vision is restored in the weak (amblyopic)
eye and the fellow eye is occluded (11, 12). However, gains in
the amblyopic eye often come at the expense of vision in the
fellow eye, may be temporary, and are rarely accompanied by
improvement in binocularity (9, 17–19). Further, as a treatment for human amblyopia, patching is limited by poor compliance, has a variable outcome, and is effective only when
initiated in early childhood (16, 19). A better understanding of
what allows recovery with patching might suggest improvements
over the current standard of care. One view is that recovery is
enabled by a reduction in cortical activity that occurs when the
strong eye is occluded (27). Support for this idea comes from
findings that exposure of rats (28) and kittens (30, 32) to
complete darkness for 10–14 d can promote recovery from the
effects of MD when visual experience is restored. The fact that
darkness, but not bilateral lid closure (31) is effective suggests
that a key variable in changing the threshold for cortical plasticity is the level and/or variance of residual retinal activity. Our
current findings using TTX to silence retinal activity directly
support this hypothesis.
Dark exposure (to lower the plasticity threshold) followed by
repetitive (55) or dichoptic (56) visual training exercises (to use
binocular cooperativity to strengthen weak synapses in V1) offers a neurobiologically sound alternative to reverse occlusion
(patching) as a treatment for amblyopia. However, previous
studies in kittens have found that very brief daily light exposure eliminated the therapeutic effects of an otherwise uninterrupted 10-d period of darkness (32). Further, shortening
the duration of absolute darkness to 5 d was insufficient to
promote recovery of visual acuity or mobilize neuroplasticity
mechanisms (30, 32). Therefore, the infrastructure and strict
compliance requirements for effective dark exposure therapy
could present a serious obstacle for clinical application of this
approach, particularly to medically underserved communities
(57, 58). In these respects, complete silencing of the retinas
could offer significant advantages over dark exposure. Our data
show rapid and complete recovery of visual responsiveness and
acuity after binocular TTX treatment can be achieved following
a single dose. In addition to shortening the treatment duration,
pharmacological inactivation of the retinas represents a portable treatment that can circumvent compliance issues associated with enforcing an extended period of darkness. If the
risks of the procedure and the duration of blockade can be
minimized, while maintaining efficacy, the brevity of the period of visual incapacitation makes it potentially of greater
appeal than the longer period of total darkness required to
promote equivalent recovery. We believe the current findings are
sufficiently compelling to justify additional preclinical studies to
establish safety, minimal treatment duration, the maximal age of

nondeprived eye (NDE), assessed using binocular vision
(BV: green) of a kitten (C349) that received two injections of TTX at P99 and P101. The period of complete
and waning retinal inactivation that ensued is depicted
by completeness of black shading. As with subsequent
panels, the rearing history is displayed in schematic form
above the graph. Gray shading shows the range of
grating acuities measured in normal kittens by use of the
same testing procedure. The designations “blind“ and
“open door” refer, respectively, to an inability or ability
to locate a closed door on the jumping stand by visual
cues alone. (C) The visual acuity of the DE and NDE
tested in three littermates (C363, C364, and C365) before
and after two binocular intravitreal injections of TTX
made at P94 and P96. All animals received a 7-d period
of MD at P30 (NDE acuity assessed monocularly: yellow;
other conventions as in A). (D) Results from C362 that
received an initial binocular TTX injection at P94 that
apparently did not achieve full retinal activity block as
the pupils were not dilated fully and visual placing behavior was still evident. Although the animal appeared
blind on the jumping stand, the acuity of the NDE recovered to normal in 8 d but the acuity of the DE
recovered only to its preinjection level. Remarkably,
following a second binocular intravitreal injection at
P135 the acuity of this eye recovered to normal levels.

treatment effectiveness, and the maximal duration of MD that
can be corrected.
In light of the translational potential, it is important to
consider questions and concerns raised by this approach.
First, TTX is a highly potent blocker of sodium-dependent
action potentials. Although systemic exposure to TTX can
be lethal, this risk is minimized by microinjection into the
eyes. TTX was chosen for our experiments because a single
treatment produces a long-lasting block of sodium channels,
but there are many other approaches to achieve the same
goal of silencing retinal output and it will be important for
future studies to evaluate these alternatives. Second, although intravitreal injections are a routine ophthalmological
procedure, they are not entirely without risk to the retina.
The benefits of this or related approaches (e.g., retrobulbar
block) will need to be weighed carefully against the risk
of complications. Finally, there is an obvious requirement
for monitoring patient safety during the period of temporary blindness.
Caveats aside, the remarkable effects of temporary inactivation of the visual pathway demonstrate that V1 synapses can be rejuvenated and at least some forms of amblyopia
can be reversed. An urgent goal of future studies will be to
assess precisely how retinal inactivation creates conditions in
the ascending visual pathway that promote recovery. For
example, it has been shown in mice that retinal silencing
with TTX can promote bursting in the LGN (41) and burst
stimulation of the geniculate can potentiate VEPs (59). Homeostatic adaptations that facilitate experience-dependent
synaptic potentiation (24, 60, 61), such as reduced cortical
inhibition and alterations in the properties of NMDA receptors (62–64), could also contribute to the therapeutic effects of retinal inactivation. We are encouraged to believe
that the approach described here, and/or the knowledge gained
by studying it, might ultimately have therapeutic potential for
the treatment of amblyopia and other types of neurological
rehabilitation.

Fig. 3. Recovery of neuron soma size in the kitten LGN following prolonged
binocular retinal inactivation. (A, Top) Schematic depicting rearing history.
Kittens received retinal TTX immediately after the period of MD to isolate
the effect of inactivation on recovery and in the absence of any visual experience. (Left) Low magnification image of the LGN stained for Nissl substance after 7-d MD started at P30. Arrow indicates deprived eye (DE) layer
(lamina A1, ipsilateral to the DE). (Scale bar, 1 mm.) (Right) High magnification images from NDE (Top) and DE (Bottom) A1 layers after 7-d MD.
(Scale bar, 25 μm.) (B and C) Same as A except that MD was followed by 10 d
of binocular retinal silencing (B) or monocular retinal silencing of the DE
(C). (D) Stereological quantification of neuron soma size within DE and NDE
A and A1 LGN layers (deprivation index, DI) revealed that after MD, DE
neurons recovered progressively during the period of binocular inactivation
so that DE and NDE neurons were of equal size by 10 d. Dashed line denotes
DI observed in normal kittens. Colors denote normal visual experience
(green), 7-d MD alone (gray), or 7-d MD followed by binocular TTX (black).
Center values and error bars, mean ± SD. (E) Average left- and right-eye
neuron soma size from age-matched normal controls (Left), and when MD
was followed by binocular (Center) or monocular (Right) retinal inactivation.
The restoration of balanced DE and NDE neuron size induced by binocular
inactivation was the product of recovery rather than generalized shrinkage
because (i) compared with monocular inactivation the size of DE neurons
after binocular treatment was significantly larger [F(2, 15) = 5.79, P = 0.013;
Bonferroni, P < 0.05], and (ii) neuron size after binocular silencing was not
different from normal control data (Bonferroni, P > 0.05). Dashed line denotes average value observed from normal kittens. Closed and open symbols
indicate measurements from A and A1 LGN layers, respectively, and colors
denote normal visual experience (green), the DE (blue), or the NDE (yellow).
