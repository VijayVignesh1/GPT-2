Patients with early infantile epileptic encephalopathy (EIEE) experience severe seizures and cognitive impairment and are at increased
risk for sudden unexpected death in epilepsy (SUDEP). EIEE13 [Online
Mendelian Inheritance in Man (OMIM) # 614558] is caused by de
novo missense mutations in the voltage-gated sodium channel gene
SCN8A. Here, we investigated the neuronal phenotype of a mouse
model expressing the gain-of-function SCN8A patient mutation,
p.Asn1768Asp (Nav1.6-N1768D). Our results revealed regional
and neuronal subtype specificity in the effects of the N1768D mutation. Acutely dissociated hippocampal neurons from Scn8aN1768D/+
mice showed increases in persistent sodium current (INa) density in
CA1 pyramidal but not bipolar neurons. In CA3, INa,P was increased in
both bipolar and pyramidal neurons. Measurement of action potential (AP) firing in Scn8aN1768D/+ pyramidal neurons in brain slices
revealed early afterdepolarization (EAD)-like AP waveforms in CA1
but not in CA3 hippocampal or layer II/III neocortical neurons. The
maximum spike frequency evoked by depolarizing current injections
in Scn8aN1768D/+ CA1, but not CA3 or neocortical, pyramidal cells was
significantly reduced compared with WT. Spontaneous firing was
observed in subsets of neurons in CA1 and CA3, but not in the neocortex. The EAD-like waveforms of Scn8aN1768D/+ CA1 hippocampal
neurons were blocked by tetrodotoxin, riluzole, and SN-6, implicating elevated persistent INa and reverse mode Na/Ca exchange in the
mechanism of hyperexcitability. Our results demonstrate that Scn8a
plays a vital role in neuronal excitability and provide insight into the
mechanism and future treatment of epileptogenesis in EIEE13.

The voltage-gated sodium channel (VGSC) Nav1.6, encoded
by SCN8A, is broadly expressed in mammalian brain (1). In
the axon initial segment of neurons, Nav1.6 regulates action potential (AP) initiation, and at nodes of Ranvier, it contributes to
saltatory conduction. Scn8a deletion in mice results in paralysis due
to failure of neuromuscular transmission, whereas partial loss-offunction mutations result in gait disorders such as ataxia and dystonia (2, 3). The activity of both excitatory and inhibitory neurons is
reduced in mutant mice lacking Nav1.6, and repetitive firing of
cerebellar Purkinje cells and other repetitively firing neurons is
impaired (1, 4–7). De novo mutations of SCN8A have been identified as an important cause of early infantile epileptic encephalopathy (EIEE) (8, 9). Epileptic encephalopathy resulting from
mutation of SCN8A is designated EIEE13 [Online Mendelian Inheritance in Man (OMIM) # 614558]. The first reported mutation,
p.Asn1768Asp, was identified in a proband with onset of convulsive
seizures at 6 mo of age (10). Comorbidities included intellectual
disability, ataxia, and sudden unexpected death in epilepsy
(SUDEP) at 15 y of age. Since then, more than 150 patients with de
novo SCN8A mutations have been identified (8, 11) (www.scn8a.
net/Home.aspx). Four large screens of individuals with epileptic
encephalopathy detected de novo mutations of SCN8A in ∼1% of
patients (13/1,557) (12–15). The common features of EIEE13
include seizure onset between birth and 18 mo of age, mild to severe cognitive and developmental delay, and mild to severe
movement disorders (11, 13). Approximately 50% of patients are
nonambulatory and 12% of published cases (5/43) experienced
SUDEP during childhood or adolescence (10, 13, 16, 17).
Almost all of the identified mutations in SCN8A are missense
mutations. Ten of these mutations have been tested functionally in
transfected cells, and eight were found to introduce changes in the
biophysical properties of Nav1.6 that are predicted to result in
neuronal hyperexcitability, including elevated persistent sodium
current (INa,P), hyperpolarizing shifts in the voltage dependence of
activation, and impaired current inactivation (10, 16, 18–21). It is
important to confirm these observations in multiple classes of
neurons expressing the mutation at a constitutive level, because
different types of neurons respond differently to mutations of
Scn8a (1) and effects in brain may differ from those in transfected
cells (e.g., ref. 22).
To investigate the pathogenic effects of SCN8A mutations in vivo,
we generated a knock-in mouse carrying the first reported patient
mutation, p.Asn1768Asp (N1768D) (23). In a transfected neuronal
cell line, this mutation generated elevated INa,P and increased excitability (10). Heterozygous Scn8aN1768D/+ mice recapitulate the
seizures, ataxia, and sudden death of the heterozygous proband,
with seizure onset at 2–4 mo of age and sudden death within 3 d (24,
25). We report that Scn8aN1768D/+ mouse excitatory and inhibitory
hippocampal neurons have region-specific increases in INa,P density
with altered AP waveforms. Our data confirm the critical role of
Significance
Patients with early infantile epileptic encephalopathy experience
severe seizures and cognitive impairment and are at increased
risk for sudden unexpected death in epilepsy (SUDEP). Here, we
investigated the neuronal phenotype of a mouse model of early
infantile epileptic encephalopathy (EIEE) 13 caused by a mutation
in the sodium channel gene SCN8A. We found that excitatory and
inhibitory neurons from mutant mice had increased persistent
sodium current density. Measurement of action potential firing in
brain slices from mutant mice revealed hyperexcitability with
spontaneous firing in a subset of neurons. These changes in
neurons are predicted to contribute to the observed seizure
phenotype in whole animals. Our results provide insights into the
disease mechanism and future treatment of patients with EIEE13.

Scn8a in neuronal excitability and provide insight into the mechanism of EIEE13.
Results
Persistent INa Is Increased in Scn8aN1768D/+ Hippocampal Neurons. CA1
and CA3 hippocampal neuron INa exhibited two components, a
large, fast transient current and a small INa,P (Fig. 1 A–D). We
compared INa,P density between WT and Scn8aN1768D/+ neurons
with bipolar and pyramidal morphologies from both hippocampal
regions. Representative images of bipolar and pyramidal neurons
are shown in Fig. 1A and B, respectively. Neurons with bipolar
morphology stain positively for MAP2 (red; Fig. 1A), GAD-67
(green; Fig. 1A and Fig. S1), and GABA (magenta; Fig. S1),
confirming their identity as inhibitory neurons. In the Scn8aN1768D/+
CA1 region, pyramidal but not bipolar neuron INa,P was increased
approximately twofold over WT, with no change in transient INa in
either population (Fig. 1 A, B, E, F, I, and J). In the Scn8aN1768D/+
CA3 region, INa,P was increased greater than twofold over WT in
both bipolar and pyramidal neurons (Fig. 1 C, D, G, H, K, and L).
For CA1 bipolar and pyramidal neurons and for CA3 bipolar
neurons, the peak of the transient INa, measured through the
entire voltage range, was not different between genotypes (Fig. 1
E–G and I–K). For CA3 pyramidal neurons, the peak transient INa
appeared to be reduced in Scn8aN1768D/+ neurons compared with
WT, but because P = 0.05, the data did not meet the criterion for
significance (Fig. 1 H and L).
Current–voltage relationships were transformed to conductance to determine activation properties. For CA1 bipolar and
pyramidal neurons, no differences in activation or inactivation
were found between genotypes (Fig. S2 A and B and Table S1).
In contrast, for CA3 pyramidal neurons (Fig. S2E and Table
S1), we observed a decrease in the activation slope (k), suggesting that mutant neurons have reduced sensitivity to
changes in membrane potential. No differences were observed
between genotypes for CA3 bipolar neurons (Fig. S2D and
Table S1). For the voltage dependence of inactivation, all
parameters of the Boltzmann equation were similar between
groups for CA3 bipolar and pyramidal neurons with the exception of the constant used to estimate INa,P (Fig. S2 E and
F). We found a greater than twofold increase in INa,P in
Scn8aN1768D/+ CA3 neurons of both types, compared with WT
(Fig. S2F and Table S1).

Early Afterdepolarization (EAD)-Like Responses and Spontaneous
Firing. We next examined passive and active membrane properties of neurons in acute brain slices prepared from the same mice
used for the isolated neuron preparations. To determine whether
effects of the mutation were brain region specific, we recorded

from the CA1, CA3, and neocortical layer II/III. Fig. 2 shows representative APs evoked by threshold current injections in CA1, CA3,
and neocortical layer II/III pyramidal cells in WT and Scn8aN1768D/+
brain slices. Scn8aN1768D/+ neocortical and CA3 neurons showed no
changes in neuronal resting membrane potential, input resistance,
threshold potential, or peak amplitude of APs compared with WT
(Table S2). For CA1, all values were similar for WT and mutant
with the exception of input resistance, which was reduced in mutant neurons (Table S2). We observed early after-depolarization
(EAD)-like events in the late decay phases of the AP waveform in
Scn8aN1768D/+ CA1, but not in CA3 or neocortical, pyramidal
neurons (Fig. 2, arrow), which resulted in increases in the decay
tau (Table S3). Consistent with this result, there were differences
between genotypes in AP duration (APD) in CA1, measured at
points of 50% (APD50) or 80% (APD80) repolarization from the
AP peak, and increased area under the AP waveform (Table S3).
We observed EAD-like waveforms in CA1 pyramidal neurons in
slices prepared from 17 of 25 Scn8aN1768D/+ mice (24 of 31 cells
examined) but in none of 14 WT mice (16 cells examined). CA3
and neocortical pyramidal neurons showed no differences in AP
rise or decay rate or AP duration between genotypes (Table S3).
These results suggest brain region and circuit level specificity of
the Scn8aN1768D/+ phenotype.
We compared the AP firing patterns of neocortical layer II/III,
CA1, and CA3 pyramidal cells in WT and Scn8aN1768D/+ brain
slices (Fig. 3). Repetitive AP firing was evoked by injection of
1,500 ms currents varying from −80 pA to 220 pA at the resting
membrane potential (RMP) of each cell. Representative traces of
repetitive AP firing evoked by injection of 60 pA of current in WT
or Scn8aN1768D/+ neocortical, CA1, or CA3 pyramidal cells are
shown in Fig. 3. We observed no differences in AP firing pattern
or maximum firing frequency in neocortical or CA3 pyramidal
neurons between genotypes (Table S2). In contrast, Scn8aN1768D/+
CA1 neurons showed EAD-like events in response to long-pulse
current injections (Fig. 3, arrows). None of the neocortical or CA3
pyramidal cells demonstrated a similar response. EAD-like responses evoked by long pulses of current in CA1 were observed
only in the low intensity range of depolarizing current injections
(<160 pA). Stronger current injections resulted in the
disappearance of EAD-like events (Fig. S3), suggesting a
membrane potential-dependent response that may involve INa
inactivation. In most EAD-like events, a single spike was
superimposed on the AP waveform (e.g., Fig. 3, arrows). Because
of the slower and broadened late decay phase of the AP in mutant
CA1 neurons (Fig. 3 and Fig. S3), the spike frequency was reduced
compared with WT.
Consistent with the difference in spike frequency, the input/
output relationships for CA1 pyramidal cells were different
between genotypes (Fig. 4A). The maximum spike frequency
evoked by depolarizing current injections in Scn8aN1768D/+ CA1
pyramidal cells was reduced compared with WT (Fig. 4 A and
C). In contrast, we found no differences in input-output relationships or maximal spike frequency in CA3 (Fig. 4 B and D).
Spontaneous firing of CA1 and CA3 pyramidal neurons was
observed in a subset of Scn8aN1768D/+ animals (8 of 27 cells
from 8 of 25 mice for CA1 and 4 of 7 cells from 4 of 7 mice for
CA3) but was not observed in 16 neurons examined from
14 WT mice (Fig. 5). Of the four mutant CA3 cells that fired
spontaneously, three showed bursting activity (e.g., arrow in
Fig. 5, Lower). Three of the eight mutant CA1 neurons that
fired spontaneously also displayed EAD-like waveforms during
spontaneous firing, suggesting intrinsic changes in neuronal
excitability.
Reverse mode activity of the Na/Ca exchanger (NCX) contributes to the mechanism of hyperexcitability in Scn8aN1768D/+ cardiomyocytes (26). We used SN-6, a reverse mode NCX inhibitor
(27), to test for a role for NCX in the EAD-like events observed in
Scn8aN1768D/+ CA1 pyramidal cells. Application of 10 μM SN-6
blocked the EAD-like waveform in all neurons examined within
5–10 min, although this effect was not reversible (Fig. 6). Treatment of control slices with artificial cerebrospinal fluid (ACSF)
containing 0.1% DMSO for 30–60 min had no effect on the AP
waveform. Treatment with the NMDA receptor antagonist D-(-)-2-
amino-5-phosphonopentanoic acid (APV) failed to block the
EAD-like response (Fig. S4). Application of 0.5 μM tetrodotoxin
(TTX) reversibly blocked the AP and EAD-like events, with the
AP returning before the EAD upon washout of TTX (Fig. 6). Finally, we tested the effects of riluzole, which blocks INa,P (28),

EAD-like waveforms (Fig. 7).
Discussion
We used Scn8aN1768D/+ knock-in mice to investigate the mechanism of seizures in SCN8A EIEE. We found increased INa,P
density in acutely isolated CA1 pyramidal and CA3 bipolar and
pyramidal neurons from mutant Scn8aN1768D/+ mice. Recording
from brain slices, we found that the Scn8a mutation did not
change neuronal RMP, input resistance, threshold potential, rising
phase tau, or peak amplitude of APs in CA3 pyramidal neurons.
In contrast, we observed EAD-like events in the late decay phases
of the AP waveform in Scn8aN1768D/+ CA1 pyramidal neurons,
leading to increases in the decay tau, the width of the AP at
APD50 and APD80, and the area under the AP. In addition, we
observed spontaneous AP firing in a subset of mutant CA1 and
CA3 pyramidal neurons. Application of SN-6, riluzole, or TTX
inhibited the EAD-like responses. We propose that Scn8aN1768D/+
hippocampal CA1 and CA3 pyramidal neurons are hyperexcitable
because of increased INa,P conducted by mutant Nav1.6 channels.
We also propose that in CA1 pyramidal neurons, increased INa,P
results in localized increases in intracellular Na+ to drive reverse
mode Na/Ca exchange and alter intracellular Ca2+ handling and
the AP waveform, as we have proposed for Scn8aN1768D/+cardiac
myocytes (26).
Importantly, INa,P was increased in mutant CA3 inhibitory
neurons, predicting that they may also exhibit increased firing
rates. Previous work demonstrated that inhibitory hippocampal
neurons display progressive synchrony and increased firing rates
minutes before the onset of pyramidal neuron hyperexcitability
and sustained ictal spiking (29, 30). Thus, increased INa,P in CA3
Scn8aN1768D/+ inhibitory neurons may be critical in the preictal
transition to spontaneous seizures in mutant hippocampus.
These combined changes in excitability and synchrony in CA3
inhibitory neurons and in CA1 and CA3 pyramidal neurons may
underlie seizures in mutant mice and provide new insights into
the mechanism of EIEE13 in humans. In our earlier work using
patient-derived induced pluripotent stem cell neurons, we proposed that increased transient INa in both pyramidal and bipolar
neurons contributes to the mechanism of SCN1A-linked Dravet
syndrome (31). Taken together, our work suggests that increased
VGSC activity in interneurons and pyramidal neurons may
contribute to the mechanism of epileptic encephalopathy.
An unexpected finding was the recording of evoked and spontaneous EAD-like waveforms in CA1 pyramidal neurons in
Scn8aN1768D/+ brain slices. EAD-like waveforms are rarely observed in central neurons, although they commonly occur in malfunctioning cardiac myocytes (32), where they have been
implicated in the cardiac arrhythmogenic phenotype of a mouse
model of Dravet syndrome (33). We showed increased incidence
of a related AP waveform, delayed afterdepolarizations (DADs),
in ventricular myocytes from Scn8aN1768D/+ mice (26). AP events
with some similarity to our results, termed depolarizing afterpotentials (DAPs), have been observed in CA1 pyramidal neurons,
but only in the presence of GABA receptor antagonists (34).
EAD-like responses in Scn8aN1768D/+ neurons occurred during
spontaneous firing or were evoked by pulses of depolarizing current injections in the absence of pharmacological agents. In addition, the time to onset of DAPs in previous studies differed from
the EAD-like events described here. DAPs were observed immediately following the AP spike, virtually overlapping the afterhyperpolarization (35). Here, EAD-like responses occurred during
the late phases of the AP waveform. Various ionic currents have
been implicated in DAPs, depending on brain region (34–38). In
rat CA1 pyramidal neurons, DAPs are mediated by NMDA receptor channels (34). Treating brain slices with the NMDA receptor antagonist APV failed to block the EAD-like response
(Fig. 7). At calyx of Held terminals, activation of resurgent INa is
postulated to be responsible for the generation of DAPs (38).
Sodium afterdepolarizations (ADPs) in rat superior colliculus
neurons were shown to arise from either persistent or resurgent
INa (39). Because of the occurrence of EAD-like responses during
the late phase of the AP and the effects of riluzole to block the
EAD in Scn8aN1768D/+ CA1 neurons, we propose that these events
are the result of increased INa,P. Our data suggest that EAD-like
events also involve altered intracellular Ca2+ homeostasis via reverse mode NCX activity. However, in contrast to previously
Fig. 4. Scn8aN1768D/+ CA1 pyramidal cells show stimulation intensitydependent reduction in AP firing frequency. APs from WT or Scn8aN1768D/+ CA1
(A) or CA3 (B) neurons were evoked by injections of 1,500-ms currents varying
from −80 pA to 180 pA. Input–output curves show frequency of AP firing vs.
stimulation intensity. All values are mean ± SEM of individual recordings from
WT (n = 11 and 6 for CA1 and CA3, respectively) and Scn8aN1768D/+ (D/+) (n = 18
and 7, for CA1 and CA3, respectively). (C and D) Comparisons of the maximum

CA1 and CA3 mice).

cells held at RMP. A subset of Scn8aN1768D/+ CA1 and CA3 pyramidal cells (8 of
20 for CA1 and 4 of 7 for CA3) fired spontaneously at RMP. EAD-like responses
(insert with expanded time scale) occurred during spontaneous firing in CA1,
but not CA3, pyramidal cells from two of eight Scn8aN1768D/+ mice. Arrow indicates bursting activity. Three of four mutant CA3 cells that fired spontaneously displayed similar bursting activity.

described events mediated primarily by Ca2+ spikes, e.g., in cerebellar inferior olivary neurons (40–42), EAD-like events in
Scn8aN1768D/+ neurons are blocked by 0.5 μM TTX, suggesting that
they are AP-dependent. Thus, although previously described
neuronal ADPs and the EAD-like events observed in this study
have different waveforms, both may arise through INa,P.
In contrast to the gain-of-function mutation of Scn8a described here, there is evidence that mutations that decrease
Nav1.6 activity are protective against seizures. Scn8a+/− mice are
resistant to the initiation and development of kindling, suggesting that Nav1.6 may participate in a self-reinforcing cycle of activity-dependent facilitation in the hippocampus (43). Similarly,
the Scn8a mutant med-jo, with a depolarizing shift in the voltage
dependence of VGSC activation (44), acts as a genetic modifier
of Dravet syndrome by returning seizure threshold to WT levels
(45). The Scn8amed-jo allele also rescued the premature lethality
of Scn1a+/− Dravet syndrome mice and extended the lifespan of
Scn1a−/− mutants (45). Reduction of Scn8a expression by conditional deletion of a floxed allele in hippocampal neurons was
protective against picrotoxin-induced seizures (46). Together
with the present study, these studies demonstrate that increased
Nav1.6 activity can be associated with a predisposition to epilepsy, whereas reduced activity can be protective. Pharmacological reduction of INa,P is being investigated as a potential
therapy for epilepsy patients (47).
Increased INa,P has been linked to pathophysiology in multiple
tissues. In cardiac myocytes, increased INa,P through Nav1.5 prolongs AP repolarization and serves as a substrate for life-threatening arrhythmias (32). In sensory neurons, enhanced INa,P,
conducted through Nav1.8, contributes to pain signaling (48).
Mutations of SCN9A, encoding Nav1.7, in patients with paroxysmal extreme pain disorder, result in sensory neuron hyperexcitability by a mechanism that includes increased INa,P (49). In brain,
increased INa,P is linked not only to epilepsy, but also to neurodegenerative disease. Increased INa,P conducted through Nav1.6
along demyelinated axons in multiple sclerosis is proposed to lead
to activation of reverse Na/Ca exchange, increased intraaxonal
Ca2+
, and axonal degeneration (50). Astrogliosis has been proposed
to occur via a mechanism of increased INa,P, via NaV1.5 (51). In
patients with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, increases in INa,P are
associated with shorter survival and riluzole is used as a therapeutic agent (52, 53). Blockers of INa,P have been proposed as
novel treatments for metastatic cancer (54). Increased INa,P in
strongly metastatic cancer cells has been shown to contribute to
abnormal intracellular Ca2+ handling (55). In conclusion, our work
adds to the growing body of evidence suggesting that increased INa,P
density leads to pathology, in this case, a severe epileptic encephalopathy. Our study demonstrates neuronal hyperexcitability in a
mouse model of EIEE13 due to mutation of SCN8A and, thus,
offers insight into the mechanism of this devastating pediatric disease. The future development of Nav1.6 selective blockers of INa,P
may lead to novel therapeutic treatments for EIEE.
Methods
Detailed methods are provided in SI Methods.
Animals. All experiments were performed in accordance with NIH guidelines
with approval from the University of Michigan Institutional Animal Care and Use
Committee. Scn8aN1768D/+ knock-in mice were generated as in refs. 23 and 24.
Preparation of Brain Slices. Acute brain slices were prepared as in ref. 56.
Acute Hippocampal Neuron Dissociation. Brain slices were prepared, and the
dentate gyrus was removed. The hippocampal region was microdissected and
transferred to oxygen saturated HBSS with calcium, magnesium, ascorbic acid,
and protease type XIV (Sigma). The tissue was rinsed with cold, oxygen saturated calcium free HBSS, transferred to cold, oxygen saturated, Na-isethionate
solution, and triturated by using silicon coated Pasteur pipettes.
INa Recordings in Isolated Hippocampal Neurons. Voltage clamp recordings
were performed as in refs. 31, 57, and 58.
Immunocytochemistry. Immunocytochemistry was performed as in ref. 59.
Brain Slice Electrophysiology. Pyramidal cells were visually identified based on
their size, shape, and location. Repetitive firing patterns and AP frequencies of
individual neurons were examined by using the whole cell current clamp
technique. AP kinetic analysis was defined within the range of AP initiation and
15 ms after trigger. Using this strategy, long EAD-like events during the late AP
decay phase occurred beyond the defined range and were not included in
analysis. CA1, CA3, and neocortical regions were examined for every mouse
except in experiments designed for pharmacological analyses.
Fig. 7. Riluzole reversibly suppresses EAD-like responses in Scn8aN1768D/+ CA1
pyramidal cells. (Top and Middle) Representative AP recordings and EADs
(arrows) before (black) and after (dashed) 10 μM riluzole for 10 min. (Bottom)
Washing the slice with ACSF for 30 min almost completely recovered the EAD
response. Traces are representative of recordings in CA1 neurons from five
Scn8aN1768D/+ mice.
Fig. 6. Reverse mode NCX inhibitor SN-6 and TTX suppress EAD-like responses
in Scn8aN1768D/+ CA1 pyramidal cells. (A and B) Representative recordings
showing the effect of 10 μM SN-6 on EAD-like responses in a Scn8aN1768D/+ CA1
neuron. EAD evoked by a short (A; 1 ms, pA varying with different suprathreshold stimulation) or long (B; 1,500 ms, 80 pA) pulse of current injection.
From top to bottom, time course of effects of 5 μM SN-6 on EAD and reversibility by washout with ACSF for 30 min. Arrows indicate EADs. (C) Representative recordings of APs and EADs before and after application of 0.5 μM
TTX for 2 min. From top to bottom, time course of reversibility of APs and
EADs following washout with TTX-free ACSF. The APs recovered before the
EADs. Traces are representative of recordings in CA1 neurons from four
Scn8aN1768D/+ mice.
