Magnetic fields from neuronal action potentials (APs) pass largely
unperturbed through biological tissue, allowing magnetic measurements of AP dynamics to be performed extracellularly or even
outside intact organisms. To date, however, magnetic techniques
for sensing neuronal activity have either operated at the macroscale
with coarse spatial and/or temporal resolution—e.g., magnetic resonance imaging methods and magnetoencephalography—or been
restricted to biophysics studies of excised neurons probed with
cryogenic or bulky detectors that do not provide single-neuron
spatial resolution and are not scalable to functional networks or
intact organisms. Here, we show that AP magnetic sensing can be
realized with both single-neuron sensitivity and intact organism
applicability using optically probed nitrogen-vacancy (NV) quantum defects in diamond, operated under ambient conditions and
with the NV diamond sensor in close proximity (∼10 μm) to the
biological sample. We demonstrate this method for excised single
neurons from marine worm and squid, and then exterior to intact,
optically opaque marine worms for extended periods and with no
observed adverse effect on the animal. NV diamond magnetometry is noninvasive and label-free and does not cause photodamage.
The method provides precise measurement of AP waveforms from
individual neurons, as well as magnetic field correlates of the AP
conduction velocity, and directly determines the AP propagation
direction through the inherent sensitivity of NVs to the associated
AP magnetic field vector.

Nitrogen-vacancy (NV) color centers are atomic-scale quantum defects that provide high-resolution magnetic field
sensing (1) and imaging via optically detected magnetic resonance (ODMR) (2), with broad applicability to both physical (3)
and biological (4–7) systems under ambient conditions. For example, NV diamond ODMR has been used to image patterns of
static magnetic fields produced by populations of living magnetotactic bacteria (5) and by immunomagnetically labeled tumor
cells (6), with resolution of ∼1 μm and field-of-view of ∼1 mm. In
the present study, we use a simple, robust apparatus (Fig. 1) with
a magnetic field sensor consisting of a macroscopic, single-crystal
diamond chip with a uniform 13-μm layer containing a high
density (∼ 3 × 1017 cm−3
) of NV centers at the top surface. The
biological specimen is placed on or directly above the NVenriched surface (Fig. 1A), providing micrometer-scale proximity
between the NV magnetic sensors and the sample, in contrast to
macroscale sensors used to sense neuronal magnetic fields or
activity (8–10). Laser light at 532 nm is applied to the sensing NV
layer through the diamond at a sufficiently shallow angle that the
light reflects off the top diamond surface (due to total internal
reflection) and therefore does not irradiate the living sample
(Fig. 1B). Microwaves (MWs) are applied to the NV sensor via
a wire loop located above the diamond, with minimal observed
perturbation to the specimen studied (11, 12) (see SI Appendix).
Laser-induced fluorescence (LIF) from the NVs is imaged onto a
photodiode, and continuous-wave electron spin resonance magnetometry (13, 14) is used to detect the magnetic field of a
propagating action potential (AP) as a time-varying shift in the
center of the ODMR spectrum, with temporal resolution as good
as ∼32 μs (see SI Appendix and Fig. S9). We regularly achieve
magnetic field sensitivity (15–17) η = 15 ± 1 pT/ ffiffiffiffiffiffi
Hz p from an
NV sensing volume (Fig. 1C) of about (13 × 200 × 2,000) μm3
,
which represents a 20-fold improvement over previous broadband NV diamond magnetometers (18) and provides signal-tonoise ratio (SNR) >1 for a single axonal AP event using matched
filtering (see SI Appendix). For each biological specimen, we
typically acquire repeated AP magnetic field measurements, often
over extended periods of time (hours). Multiple synchronized,
consecutive AP measurements (Navg) can also be averaged together to increase the AP SNR (see Methods and SI Appendix).
Results
We first performed magnetic sensing of single-neuron propagating APs from excised invertebrate giant axons, together with
simultaneous electrophysiology measurements on the axons as a
Significance
We demonstrate noninvasive detection of action potentials
with single-neuron sensitivity, including in whole organisms.
Our sensor is composed of quantum defects within a diamond
chip, which detect time-varying magnetic fields generated by
action potentials. The sensor is biocompatible and can be
brought into close proximity to the organism without adverse
effect, allowing for long-term observation and superior resolution of neuron magnetic fields. Optical magnetic detection
with quantum defects also provides information about action
potential propagation that is not easily available with existing
methods. The quantum diamond technique requires no labeling or genetic modification, allows submillisecond time resolution, does not bleach, and senses through opaque tissue.
With further development, we expect micrometer-scale magnetic imaging of a variety of neuronal phenomena.

comparison and check on the magnetic data. We studied two
species, with consistent results: the marine fanworm Myxicola
infundibulum and the North Atlantic longfin inshore squid Loligo
pealeii—a model organism for neuroscience. Details of specimen preparation, axonal AP stimulation, and electrophysiology
measurements and simulations are described in Methods and SI
Appendix. Fig. 2A shows a representative measured intracellular
axonal AP voltage time trace Φmeas
in ðtÞfrom M. infundibulum. In a
simple model of the electromagnetic dynamics of axonal propagating APs (19–21) (see SI Appendix), the magnetic field BðtÞ is
proportional to the temporal derivative of the intracellular
voltage ΦinðtÞ: BðtÞ =sð∂Φin=∂tÞ, where s is a scaling constant
dependent on geometrical parameters (axon radius ra, radial
distance of the field point to the axon center ρ) and electrophysiological axon parameters (AP conduction velocity vc, axoplasm electrical conductivity σ). As shown in Fig. 2 B and C, we
find good agreement between (i) BcalcðtÞ, the AP magnetic field
calculated from Φmeas
in ðtÞfor a typical value of s for M. infundibulum,
and (ii) a representative measured AP magnetic field time trace
BmeasðtÞ. This correspondence demonstrates the consistency of
NV diamond magnetic AP measurements with standard electrophysiology techniques and theory. Note that the example
BmeasðtÞ in Fig. 2C has a peak-to-peak amplitude =4.1±0.2 nT
(mean ± SD for four measurements on the same specimen each
with Navg = 150; see SI Appendix and Fig. S11A), corresponding
to an SNR of 1.2±0.1 for a single AP firing, i.e., Navg = 1. Here
SNR is defined as the ratio of the mean signal peak-to-peak
amplitude to the root mean square (RMS) noise after matched
filtering is applied (see SI Appendix for SNR calculation and
SNR analysis in terms of spike detection probabilities using a
next-generation neuron magnetic sensor). Furthermore, we
demonstrated that our method has multispecies capability via
magnetic sensing of axonal APs from the squid L. pealeii (Fig.
2D). No change to the apparatus or magnetic sensing protocol is
required upon switching organisms, and good reproducibility is
found for both the excised worm and squid axon AP magnetic
field measurements, on the same and different specimens (see SI
Appendix and Figs. S10 A and B and S11).
We next demonstrated single-neuron AP magnetic sensing exterior to a live, intact, opaque organism—an undissected specimen
of M. infundibulum (Fig. 3A)—for extended periods, with minimal
adverse effect on the animal. Fig. 3B shows an example measured
axonal AP magnetic field time trace BmeasðtÞfor a live intact specimen,
which is a demonstration of single-neuron magnetoencephalography

(MEG) from the exterior of an intact animal. The measured AP
waveform in Fig. 3B is similar to that of an excised axon (Fig.
2C), with roughly 4 times smaller peak-to-peak amplitude (∼1
nT), which is consistent with the separation of ∼1.2 mm from the
center of the axon inside the animal to the NV sensing layer (see
transverse sections and diagrams in Fig. 4 A−D, SI Appendix, and
Fig. S1D). In addition, we recorded BmeasðtÞ from a live intact
worm after >24 h of continuous exposure to the experimental
conditions, including applied MWs and optical illumination of
the diamond sensor. We observed little to no change in the
magnetic AP signal or in the animal behavior (see SI Appendix
and Fig. S10C).
We also used live intact worms to demonstrate the capability
of NV diamond magnetic sensing to determine the AP propagation direction and sense magnetic signal amplitude differences
correlated with differences in conduction velocity vc, all from
a single-channel measurement. NV diamond allows for vector
magnetometry (22) by sensing the magnetic field projection
along one or more of the four NV center orientations within the
diamond crystal lattice (see SI Appendix and Figs. S3 and S4). An
axonal AP produces a bipolar azimuthal magnetic field waveform, with the time-varying field orientation set by the direction
of AP propagation (Figs. 1A and 4D). Thus, the measured AP
magnetic field time trace BmeasðtÞ from an intact worm has an
inverted waveform for anterior versus posterior AP stimulation,
demonstrating clear distinguishability between oppositely propagating APs, as shown in Fig. 4 E and F, for three intact specimens (denoted worms F, G, and H) with both posterior and
anterior stimulation, each with Navg = 1,650 trials.
In addition to inversion of the BmeasðtÞ waveform upon reversal
of the AP propagation direction, an asymmetry is observed in the
peak-to-peak amplitude of the magnetic signal. As shown in Fig.
4 E and F, larger peak-to-peak values of BmeasðtÞ are found for
posterior stimulation (denoted Bp) than for anterior stimulation
(Ba) for each of the three worms tested: Bp=Ba = 1.66±0.12 for
worm F, 1.28±0.09 for worm G, and 1.27±0.10 for worm H
(mean ± SD for 1,650 trials for each sample). One-tailed P
values from a Student’s t test for the three samples are
1.3 × 10−8
, 9.9 × 10−4
, and 2.9 × 10−3
, respectively. The average asymmetry is Bp=Ba = 1.41 ±0.22 (mean ± SD for three
samples). The asymmetry is independent of which point of
stimulation (posterior or anterior) is tested first, and the effect is
robust under multiple switches of stimulation (e.g., posterior,
anterior, then posterior again).
To understand the origin of the observed asymmetry of BmeasðtÞ
with AP propagation direction, we (i) performed electrophysiology measurements of ΦinðtÞ and vc with both posterior and
anterior stimulation (see Methods, SI Appendix, and Fig. S2);
(ii) related the magnetic and electrophysiology data via the
simple magnetic model (see above and SI Appendix), which
predicts Bp=Ba = vc,a=vc,p × ð∂Φp=∂tÞ=ð∂Φa=∂tÞ for measurements
taken at a fixed location z0; and (iii) performed numerical simulations of APs using a model of the M. infundibulum giant axon
(see SI Appendix). Here, vc,p and vc,a are the conduction velocities
for posterior and anterior stimulation, respectively, and ð∂Φp=∂tÞ
and ð∂Φa=∂tÞ are the respective maximal temporal derivatives of
the intracellular AP ΦinðtÞ. From electrophysiology measurements
(detailed in SI Appendix), we find a significant difference between
vc,p and vc,a resulting in vc,a=vc,p × ð∂Φp=∂tÞ=ð∂Φa=∂tÞ= 1.35±0.25
(mean ± SD), which is consistent with the ratio of Bp=Ba measured
with NV diamond magnetometry. Previous calculations based on
cable theory (23) suggest that such asymmetry in vc [and hence
BmeasðtÞ] is expected for axons exhibiting a tapered radius over
their length, as is the case for the giant axon in M. infundibulum
(24). To investigate whether tapered morphology contributes to
the observed Bp=Ba asymmetry, we performed simulations based
on cable theory (NEURON software) (25) of APs in a model
tapered axon with geometrical and electrophysiological properties
consistent with typical values for M. infundibulum (see Methods
and SI Appendix). We find propagation-direction−dependent
asymmetry for both vc and ∂Φ=∂t at the midpoint of the model
axon with vc,a=vc,p × ð∂Φp=∂tÞ=ð∂Φa=∂tÞ= 1.4, which is consistent with the asymmetry observed in NV diamond magnetic
measurements and electrophysiology measurements of APs in
M. infundibulum. These results demonstrate the capability of our
technique to measure small differences in magnetic signal
waveforms correlated with differences in conduction velocity,
which, in the present study, have contributions from differences
in axon morphology.
Discussion
In the present work, we exploit two key advantages of NV diamond for magnetic sensing of living biological systems—ability
to bring the NV sensors into close proximity to the signal source
and operation under ambient conditions (biocompatibility)—
to demonstrate single-neuron axonal AP magnetic sensing within
∼10 μm of the specimens. By comparison, sensitive superconducting quantum interference devices (SQUIDs) (8) and
atomic (26) magnetometers used for MEG (9) and neuron biophysics studies typically operate with standoff distances of several millimeters or more from the biological sample, as they
function under extreme temperature conditions (cryogenic and
heated, respectively) and have extended sensor geometries. Although SQUIDS can operate with sensitivity of ∼1 fT/ ffiffiffiffiffiffi
Hz p (27),
the much closer proximity of the NV diamond sensor to the
neuronal signal source boosts the measurement SNR by several
orders of magnitude for a given magnetic field sensitivity (see SI
Appendix) and, additionally, for a given SNR, enables a higherquality reconstruction of source currents from a magnetic field
map (28). Furthermore, operation of an NV magnetometer at a
distance much closer than the AP wavelength λAP (of order
∼1 mm for unmyelinated mammalian axons) (29, 30) can provide
a more accurate determination of AP currents due to the reduced

contribution from extracellular return currents (30), which significantly attenuate AP signals at standoff distances J λAP. A third
key advantage of NV diamond technology is straightforward
parallelization of optically detected NV sensors to provide widefield magnetic imaging with micrometer-scale spatial resolution,
e.g., by imaging fluorescence from the NV sensing layer onto a
camera (5). In combination with close proximity, the high spatial
resolution provided by NV diamond magnetic imaging enables
sensitivity to magnetic fields generated by currents on small length
scales (31), which tend to cancel at the typical standoff distances of
other magnetometers. With both source-to-sensor standoff distance and spatial resolution at the micrometer scale, a wide variety
of neuronal current sources and sinks could be resolvable with NV
diamond magnetic imaging (see SI Appendix).
Key technical challenges to realize a next-generation NV diamond magnetic imager suitable for neuroscience applications
include (i) improving the magnetic field sensitivity (32, 33) to
enable real-time, single axonal AP event detection from individual mammalian neurons, which are expected to generate peak
AP magnetic fields up to ∼1 nT at the NV sensor layer (see SI
Appendix); and (ii) incorporating wide-field imaging of transient
AP magnetic fields with micrometer-scale resolution. The imaging
challenge can be met by adapting established NV techniques for
wide-field imaging of static magnetic fields in biological samples
(5, 6) to be able to acquire repeated, fast (<0.1 ms) images. This
capability can then be integrated with tomographic methods
similar to those used in MEG (9, 34, 35), such as spatial filtering
(28, 36), to confront the inverse problem (37) of assigning measured magnetic waveforms from axonal APs, soma, and other
neuronal processes to individual cells within a crowded field of
neurons (see SI Appendix and Fig. S14). Prior knowledge about
the neuronal sample, such as the cell network geometry, axon
morphology, and degree of myelination, could aid magnetic signal
localization as well as determination of the physiological origin of

is reversed depending on AP propagation direction, and the average ratio of the magnetic signal amplitude of posterior-stimulated APs (Bp) and anteriorstimulated APs (Ba) from the three specimens shown (worms F, G, and H) is Bp/Ba = 1.41 ± 0.22 (mean ± SD for three samples, each with Navg = 1,650),
consistent with two-point electrophysiology measurements of lower AP conduction velocity for posterior stimulation (see SI Appendix and Fig. S2).

signal differences between individual neurons, e.g., arising from
variations in AP conduction velocity (see SI Appendix). The sensitivity challenge can be addressed by engineering optimized diamonds (38) with higher N-to-NV conversion efficiency and longer
spin-dephasing times Tp
2 (39), and by implementing pulsed Ramsey
(40) and double-quantum (41, 42) measurement protocols: The
volume-normalized sensitivity is expected to be enhanced nearly
300-fold from the present 34 nT·μm−3/2·Hz−1/2 to an estimated
118 pT·μm−3/2·Hz−1/2, and the temporal resolution is expected
to reach ∼2 μs (43) (see SI Appendix). Along with the anticipated
sensitivity improvement, the smaller sensing volume V of a nextgeneration instrument should yield a ∼6,000-fold gain in the figure
of merit 1=ðηVÞ relevant for fields containing spatial information,
such as is expected from dense neuronal networks (see SI Appendix).
To realize further sensitivity enhancements, quantum-assisted
techniques (41, 42, 44, 45) could enable measurements approaching
fundamental quantum limits. Our present NV diamond instrument
has a photon shot-noise-limited magnetic field sensitivity ∼1,500
times worse than the quantum spin projection limit (see SI Appendix), highlighting the potential for large sensitivity gains. For example, it was recently demonstrated that spin-to-charge-state readout
for single NV centers provides enhanced magnetic field sensitivity
that is only a factor of 3 above the spin projection limit (46).
The sensitivity and imaging challenges are related, as there are
trade-offs between magnetic field sensitivity and spatial and
temporal resolution for a given NV density in the sensor layer
(47). To assess these trade-offs to inform future studies, we
calculated the expected spatial resolution and SNR of a nextgeneration NV diamond magnetic imager with a projected volume-normalized sensitivity of 118 pT·μm−3/2·Hz−1 when sensing
propagating APs from mammalian neurons (see SI Appendix and
Fig. S13). Note that the optimal resolution and SNR for a given
sensitivity depend on the nature, number, and spacing of current
sources being measured. As an example, we simulated expected
magnetic field maps of AP signals from multiple overlapping
mammalian axons with added fluctuations due to magnetometer
shot noise, and then performed modest spatial filtering of the
simulated data to demonstrate the capability for enhanced SNR
with image processing (see SI Appendix, Fig. S14). Furthermore,
the flexibility afforded by optical readout allows further optimization of the SNR of single AP events through more advanced
spatial and temporal filtering methods (48) (see SI Appendix). For
the next-generation NV diamond magnetic imager discussed here,
we expect to achieve a single-shot SNR J 10 for single axonal AP
events and to distinguish magnetic signals in mammalian neuronal
systems with an average spacing between neurons of ∼10 μm.
We envision the next-generation NV diamond magnetic imager
being applicable to noninvasive monitoring of AP activity and
neuronal currents in a broad range of systems, including species
for which genetic encoding and viral transduction of voltage-sensitive proteins is not currently practical. A possible near-term
application, which exploits the capability of NV diamond to provide magnetic sensing with a few micrometers’ proximity to a biological sample, is mapping spatial variations in axonal magnetic
fields, e.g., due to changes in AP conduction velocity affected by
demyelinating diseases such as multiple sclerosis (49). In addition,
NV diamond magnetic imaging could be combined with optical
stimulation methods (50) to provide individual neuron-targeted
excitation and noninvasive AP detection, enabling longitudinal
studies of environmental and developmental effects (51, 52), as
well as tests of models used to interpret conventional MEG signals
from macroscopic brain circuits. When the sensor-to-source distance is well characterized, measurement of the magnetic field can
give a more direct determination of axonal current than a measurement of voltage, as the former does not require assuming a
fixed conduction velocity, the calculation of temporal derivatives, or
any additional prior knowledge of electrophysiological parameters
such as neuronal or bath conductivities (see SI Appendix). Thus,
a next-generation NV diamond magnetic imager could be used
to map the spatial and temporal profiles of currents in tapered
axons, bifurcations of neuronal structures, and many other
neuronal processes of nontrivial shape. With further advances in
NV diamond magnetic field sensitivity, it may also be possible to
measure current flow through nonaxonal processes such as the
soma and dendrites, which may add insight to the present understanding of the role of such phenomena in AP initiation and
computing in complex neuronal systems (53, 54).
Methods
M. infundibulum Properties and Acquisition. M. infundibulum specimens
possess a large giant axon (24), are readily available year-round, and can be
kept for long periods of time in laboratory environments. The giant axon
mediates a rapid escape reflex; electrical or physical stimulus elicits a violent
muscular contraction, which can shorten the worm by 50% or more compared with the relaxed state. Specimens are obtained from a commercial supplier (Gulf of Maine Inc.) or a research laboratory (University of
California, Davis, Bodega Bay Marine Biology Laboratory). Worms are housed
in a 208-L aquarium filled with artificial seawater (ASW) from a commercial
supplier (Instant Ocean Sea Salt), and the temperature is stabilized to 7.5 ±
0.5 °C. Worms are fed a plankton-based food source (Sera Marin Coraliquid)
every 14 d. Large specimens of length ∼60 mm and diameter >5 mm (both
measured when fully contracted) are used in the magnetic measurements.
Electrophysiology measurements (55) use worms of length >30 mm and diameter >3.5 mm.

and Goldman method is followed (56). (i) The ventral side of M. infundibulum is identified by a triangular structure on the thorax (57). (ii) The
worm is pinned ventral side down in a glass dish spray-painted flat black
(Krylon Ultra Flat Black #1602) and filled with polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS)
(Dow Corning Sylgard 184). The specimen is illuminated with broadband
white light at a shallow grazing angle. The painted dish and lighting increase contrast between the axon and the surrounding tissue for better
visibility. The preparation is submerged in chilled ASW throughout. (iii) A
median dorsal incision of length ∼2 cm is made through the body wall at the
midsection of the animal. Further cuts sever connective tissue between the
body wall and the gut. (iv) The freed body wall is pinned to the PDMS away
from the axon with substantial tension (see ref. 56). (v) The gut is partially
lifted (vertically up) from the body wall, allowing fine vanassas scissors to cut
the connective tissue connecting the gut to the body wall. The gut is excised
from the specimen, revealing the dorsal side of the ventral nerve cord
containing the giant axon. (vi) The ventral blood vessels and additional
tissue close to the axon are carefully stripped away with fine forceps, further
exposing the nerve cord as shown in SI Appendix, Fig. S1 A and B. (vii) Additional cuts through the body wall remove tissue around the nerve cord as
shown in SI Appendix, Fig. S1C. (viii) The excised nerve cord (still connected
to the undissected worm anterior and posterior) is then placed dorsal side
down on the diamond sensor chip. In this configuration, the worm is alive,
and AP firing can continue for 72 h or longer. A flexible acrylic clamp holds
the nerve cord fixed against the diamond chip to restrain the worm’s muscle
contractions (58). Axon viability is checked periodically through physical or
electrical stimulus at the worm posterior and confirmation of muscle response
at the worm anterior. For studies of intact specimens of M. infundibulum, the
worm is cleaned of accumulated mucus and placed in an acrylic jig to fix the
dorsal side of the animal closest to the NV layer of the diamond. For both
excised axons and live, intact worms, the specimen preparation is continuously
perfused with 10 °C ASW with a gaseous solute of 99.5% O2 and 0.5% CO2.
APs are evoked by a current pulse of duration Δtstim by a suction electrode
engaging either the specimen posterior or anterior, and driven by an isolated pulse stimulator (A-M Systems Model 2100) producing biphasic pulses
(positive polarity first) with 10-mA amplitude. Posterior stimulation is used
unless otherwise noted. The value of Δtstim is typically set to twice the
stimulation threshold, and ranges from 100 μs to 1 ms depending on the size
and health of the organism and the degree of contact between the worm
body and the suction electrode. Stimulation pulses are applied at repetition
rate fstim ≈0.4 Hz. Successful AP stimulation and propagation are verified
with a pair of bipolar platinum recording microelectrodes (World Precision
Instruments PTM23B10 or PTM23B05) connected to a differential amplifier
(A-M Systems Model 1800 Headstage), which is further amplified (A-M
Systems Model 1800) and then digitized (National Instruments USB-6259) at
250 kHz. For the intact worm studies, the same recording electrodes are

gently positioned in contact with the worm skin near the axon, allowing
verification of AP propagation. Care is taken to not puncture the skin to
avoid damaging the specimen.
L. pealeii Acquisition, Preparation, and AP Stimulation. Specimens of L. pealeii
are acquired seasonally from the Marine Biological Laboratory in Woods
Hole, MA, with medium to large squid (0.3 m to 0.5 m in overall length)
chosen for the present studies. Following decapitation of the squid, the
postsynaptic giant axons are isolated following the protocol described in ref.
59. The axons are placed in vials containing calcium-free saline solution and
stored on ice. The iced vials are transported from Woods Hole to our laboratory at Harvard University (90-min drive). The isolated axons maintain viability for up to 12 h after initial excision. For studies of the excised giant
axon of L. pealeii, a squid buffer solution (475 mM NaCl, 115 mM MgCl2,
10 mM CaCl2, 10 mM KCl, 3 mM NaHCO3, and 10 mM Hepes) chilled to 10 °C
perfuses the axon. AP stimulation and extracellular voltage detection is accomplished through the same methods used for M. infundibulum, save for
an increase in the stimulation repetition rate fstim. The squid giant axon can
be fired as often as 100 Hz without reducing detected AP signal quality. For
increased longevity of squid axons, stimulation is applied at fstim =25 Hz for
15 s followed by a rest period of 15 s.
