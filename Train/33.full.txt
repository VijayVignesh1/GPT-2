Rapamycin is an immunosuppressive immunophilin ligand re-
ported as having neurotrophic activity. We show that modification
of rapamycin at the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR)
binding region yields immunophilin ligands, WYE-592 and lLS-920,
with potent neurotrophic activities in cortical neuronal cultures,
efficacy in a rodent model for ischemic stroke, and significantly
reduced immunosuppressive activity. Surprisingly, both com-
pounds showed higher binding selectivity for FKBP52 versus
FKBP12, in contrast to previously reported immunophilin ligands.
Affinity purification revealed two key binding proteins, the immu-
nophilin FKBP52 and the B1-subunit of L-type voltage-dependent
Ca2+ channels (CACNB1). Electrophysiological analysis indicated
that both compounds can inhibit L-type Ca2+ channels in rat
hippocampal neurons and F-11 dorsal root ganglia (DRG)/neuro-
blastoma cells. We propose that these immunophilin ligands can
protect neurons from Ca2+-induced cell death by modulating Ca2+
channels and promote neurite outgrowth via FKBP52 binding.

mmunophilin ligands, such as FK506, cyclosporin A, rapamycin,

3-n0rmeridamycin, V-10,367, and GPI-1046, have been shown to
have neuroprotective activities (174). Immunophilins comprise the
family of FK506—binding proteins (FKBPs) having peptidyl—prolyl
CL'S-trans isomerase (PPIase) activities and were proposed as likely
targets for mediating this neurotrophic activity, although there is
disagreement as to their specific mechanism (577). Over two dozen
immunophilins occur in the human genome and are known to
associate with a diverse array of proteins, including ion channels
(7711), steroid receptor complexes (5), transcription factors (12),
and Bcl—2 upon conditional activation (6). Immunophilin ligands
generate various downstream biological activities by disruption of
the natural FKBP-containing complexes (5712) or by formation of
novel ternary complexes, such as FKBP127FK506icalcineurin (13,
14) or FKBP127rapamycin7mammalian target of rapamycin
(mTOR) (15). The ternary complexes of FK506 and rapamycin
with their respective protein targets result in immunosuppressive
activity that may be undesirable in the context of a therapy for
neurodegenerative conditions (9). FK506 and rapamycin bind
multiple immunophilin isoforms, increasing the risk that Off-target
activities will lead to unanticipated or adverse effects. For example,
the interaction of FK506 (which binds to many FKBPs) with
FKBP12.6 is potentially problematic because the compound can
disrupt the interaction between FKBP12.6 and the ryanodine
receptor, causing Ca2+ leakage from endoplasmic and sarcoplasmic
reticula and further resulting in impairment of the excitationi
contraction coupling in cardiac muscle (9). Therefore, activities that
stem from inhibition of multiple FKBPs make FK506 a problematic

candidate for treating neurodegenerative conditions, even though
the compound has shown efficacy in rodent models of stroke (16).

We used a structure-based drug design approach to determine
whether semisynthetic analogs of rapamycin (rapalogs) that were
nonimmunosuppressive and showed some selectivity for immu-
nophilin binding might be desirable candidates for additional in vivo
study. Reported here are the chemical syntheses of two neuropro-
tective, nonimmunosuppressive rapalogs, WYE-592 and ILS-920,
which bind selectively to the immunophilin FKBP52 and t0 the
Bl-subunit 0f L-type voltage-gated calcium channels (VGCC). An
investigation of the mechanistic basis of their action revealed
unique interaction partners resulting in the modulation of intra-
cellular Ca2+ homeostasis.

Results

Chemical Syntheses of Rapamycin Analogs. Rapamycin is a hybrid
polyketide/nonribosomal peptide macrolide that forms a ternary
complex of FKBP127rapamycinimTOR that inhibits mTOR ki-
nase activity and leads to immunosuppression (14). T0 disrupt the
interaction with mTOR while leaving the FKBP-binding portion of
the compound intact, with the aim of reducing mTOR-mediated
immunosuppressive activity while maintaining neuroprotective ac-
tivity, we prepared WYE-592 from rapamycin Via a [4 + 2]
cycloaddition reaction with nitrosobenzene at the C1, C3 diene, and
ILS—920 from further catalytic hydrogenation of WYE-592 (Fig.
1A). Both compounds were purified by HPLC and fully character-
ized (including stereochemistry) by 2D NMR analyses [supporting
information (SI) Table 2].

lLS-920 is a Nonimmunosuppressive Rapamycin Analog. Inhibition of
IL-2-stimulated human CD4+ T cell proliferation was used as an in
vitro measure of immunosuppression. ILS—920 showed no inhibition
up to 5 MM, in contrast to rapamycin and FK506 (ICso = 5 nM and
1 nM, respectively; Table 1). WYE-592 exhibited intermediate
activity (ICso = 150 nM) arising from a 3% conversion of the
sample to rapamycin Via a retro DielsiAlder reaction (data not
shown), which indicated that modiﬁcation at the mTOR binding

mycin by more than three orders of magnitude.

lLS-920 and WYE-592 Promote Neuronal Survival and Stimulate Neu-
rite Outgrowth. ILS-920 and WYE-592 were found to promote
neuronal survival, as measured by neurofilament ELISA in cultured
rat cortical neurons (Fig. 1B and Table 1), with up to an order of
magnitude improvement in activity versus rapamycin. The com-
pounds also promote neurite outgrowth in both cortical neurons
(Fig. 1C) and F—11 cells [a hybrid of rat DRG neurons and mouse
neuroblastoma (17), SI Fig. 6C], with comparable ECSO values (see
Table 1). Both compounds demonstrated significantly greater
potency in these neuronal assays than the previously reported
neuroprotective immunophilin ligand GPI—1046 (Table 1).

lLS-920 and WYE-592 Bind to FKBP52 and the B-Subunit of L-Type
VGCC. With the aim of identifying putative target proteins, afﬁnity
matrices with covalently attached compound were prepared and
used to precipitate proteins from F—11 cell lysates. As shown in Fig.
2A, three strong bands (220 kDa, 60 kDa, and 50 kDa) and two weak
bands (25 kDa and 12 kDa) were found in both WYE-592 and
ILS-920 pull-down fractions. Fourier-transform ion cyclotron res-
onance (FT-ICR) MS spectra of each band were used for Mascot
searches in the National Center for Biotechnology Information

FKBP38/CaZ+/CaM, FKBP25, and FKBP12 separately, and individual pull-down
experiments were analyzed by SDS/PAGE to assess binding affinity.

(NCBI) database (SI Table 3). FKBP52 (5) and the B-subunits 0f
the L-type VGCC (18, 19) were identified as targets of WYE-592
and ILS-920 with high P values, and their presence was conﬁrmed
by Western blot analysis (Fig. 2 B and C). FKBP25 and FKBP12 also
were identified as weaker bands, whereas myosin and actin were
found in all fractions, indicating nonspecific binding to the resin.

lLS-920 and WYE-592 Exhibit Highly Selective Binding to FKBP52. The
observation that FKBPS 2 was the predominant immunophilin that
was affinity-purified from F11 cell lysates with resin-bound WYE-
592 and ILS-920 suggested that either FKBP52 is enriched in F11
cells relative to other immunophilins or that WYE-S 92 and ILS—920
exhibit binding selectivity for FKBP52. RT-PCR was carried out to
measure the mRNA level offkbpla (the gene encoding FKBP12)
and fkbp4 (the gene encoding FKBP52) in F11 cells. The mRNA
level of fkbpla was four times higher than that 0ff7cbp4, indicating
that WYE-592 and ILS—920 may bind selectivity to FKBP52. To
determine the specific affinity of WYE-592 and ILS-920 t0
FKBP52, we measured binding constants. ILS-920 and WYE-592
both demonstrated a preference for binding to FKBP52 relative to
FKBP12 (229- and 8-f01d, respectively) whereas FK506 and rapa-
mycin bind to both proteins with comparable affinities (Table 1).
GPI-1046 showed very weak binding affinity to both FKBP12 and
FKBP52. To further probe the specificity of immunophilin/

cyclophilin interaction, and because of their reported role in
neuroprotection from ischemic injury (6, 7, 12), the binding of
WYE-592 and ILS-920 to purified recombinant FKBP25, FKBP38,
and cyclophilin D (ppif) was measured [all proteins were demon-
strated to be catalytically active in a peptidyl prolyl cis-trans
isomerase assay (SI Fig. 7A)]. Binding of ILS-920, WYE-592,
rapamycin, and FK506 to individual proteins was confirmed by
affinity precipitation followed by SDS/PAGE analysis (Fig. 2D) or
Via measurement of binding constants (Table 1). To further confirm
this result, the binding of [14C]WYE-592 to individual proteins was
measured (SI Fig. 7B). At 10 1.1M, the afﬁnity of [14C]WYE-592
binding to these targets can be ranked in the relative order:
(FKBP52, FKBP12, FKBP25) >> PPID >> PPIF and FKBP38/
CaZT/CaM. These results indicate that WYE-592 and ILS-920,
although retaining some affinity for FKBP12 and FKBP25, have a
pronounced binding selectivity for FKBP52.

lLS-920 and WYE-592 Bind to the B-Subunit of L-Type VGCC. The
presence of the Other key binding protein, the Bl-subunit 0f
L-type voltage-dependent Ca2+ channels (CACNB1), was vali-
dated by testing the binding of recombinant Bl-subunit
(CACNBlzTGG548TAA) by affinity precipitation followed by
SDS/PAGE analysis; WYE-592 and ILS-920 bind to the [31-
subunit but not rapamycin 0r FK506 (Fig. 2C). The binding of
WYE-592 t0 the Bl-subunit was further tested in a radioactivity
assay and by protein tryptophan fluorescent quenching analy-
sis. At 10 1.1M, [14C]WYE-592 bound to a mutant His6-
CACNB1:TGG548TAA and weakly to CACNB4 (SI Fig. 7C).
This also was confirmed by protein tryptophan fluorescent
quenching (SI Fig. 7D), a linear doseiresponse indicating con-
formational changes upon binding WYE-592 t0 CACNB1. To
determine whether FKBP52 and CACNB1 can associate with
each other, the lysates of F11 cells in the presence or absence of
5 1.1M WYE-592 were immunoprecipitated with anti-FKBP52
antibody, followed by Western analysis Of the immunoprecipi-
tated fractions with anti-CACNBl antibody to detect the co-
precipitation of the Bl-subunit. As shown in SI Fig. 7E, the
Bl-subunit was not coimmunoprecipitated with FKBP52 in the
absence of WYE-592, indicating that FKBP52 does not associate
with CACNB1 in F11 cells.

RNAi Knockdown of FKBP52 Enhanced Neurite Outgrowth. To further
understand the role of FKBP52 and the B—subunit 0f the VGCC in
mediating the neuroregenerative effects of WYE-592 and ILS-920,
mRNA knockdown using siRNA was performed in cortical neu-
rons. As shown in Fig. 3A, siRNA against FKBP52 and CACNBl
reduced the expression of the corresponding protein by 70786%,
whereas the expression of actin remained the same. Total neurite
outgrowth was significantly increased in FKBP52 siRNA-treated
neurons (125 :r 12% of control; Fig. 3 B and C) and negligibly in
CACNB1 siRNA-treated neurons, which suggests that inhibition of
FKBP52 stimulates neurite outgrowth, providing a strong mecha-
nistic rationale for the neurite outgrowth observed after ILS-920
and WYE-592 treatment.

lLS-920 and WYE-592 Inhibit L-Type Ca2+ Current in Hippocampal
Neurons and F-11 Cells. The L-type VGCC (18, 19) contains multiple
subunits: a membrane-spanning a-subunit forms the Ca2+ channel
pore, and one of four B—subunits associate with the a—subunit to
regulate the gating of the channel. The Blb-, 133-, and B4-subunits
are known to enhance the L—type Ca2+ channel current, whereas the
B2-subunit plays a negative role (18, 19). Because we have shown
that ILS-920 0r WYE-592 bind to at least one Of the B-subunits, we
chose to investigate further the effect of both compounds on the
function of L—type VGCC by electrophysiological analysis.

After external application of WYE-592 0r FK506 t0 the bath
solution, whole-cell Ca2+ currents in F—11 cells were recorded. A
49% decrease of the Ca2+ current density (6.5 :r 0.5 to 3.2 :r 0.3

pA/pF) was observed after incubation of WYE-592 (data not
shown), similar to that observed for FK506, as has been reported
(20). The effect of WYE-592 0n L-type VGCC also was studied in
F—11 cells by intracellular application of WYE-592. As shown in Fig.
4 A and B, upon break-in WYE-592 began to inhibit the Ca2+
current in F11 cells and a steady state was reached after total Ca2+
current was reduced by 46 :r 1.8% within 10 min. Interestingly, once
a steady state was obtained with WYE-592 little further block of
Ca2+ current was Observed with the L-type VGCC antagonist
BAY-K5552 (Fig. 4B), indicating the response to WYE-592 was
predominantly on L-type VGCC current in F—11 cells. Rapamycin
is reported to have no effect on L-type VGCC current (21),
suggesting that WYE-592 has obtained a unique activity, relative to
the parent compound, by inhibiting L-type VGCC current.

To further determine whether the Observed effects on Ca2+
currents were specific to the modiﬁcations we had made, ILS—920
and rapamycin were tested in a more physiologically relevant
context of cultured rat hippocampal neurons (Fig. 4 C and D).
L—type VGCC was isolated by blockade of N-type Ca2+ channels
with wCTX-GVIA (100 nM). Intracellular application of ILS—920
(10 1.1M) resulted in inhibition of 74.5 :r 8.8% of the Ca2+ current
after 10 min (Fig. 4 C andD, red filled circles). This response could
be prevented by BAY-K5552, indicating that the inhibition was
predominantly of L-type VGCC (Fig. 4D, red open circles). Essen-
tially no current changes were Observed in the vehicle control
recordings in the presence of wCTX-GVIA 0r wCTX-GVIA plus
BAY-K5552 (Fig. 4D, black, filled or open squares, respectively).
Finally, intracellular application of rapamycin yielded no change in
L—type VGCC currents (Fig. 4D, black filled triangles). Because
ILS—920 inhibited Ca2+ currents in the presence of N-type blockers,
but not in the presence of both L-type and N-type blockers, we
conclude that ILS-920 selectively inhibits the L—type VGCC. More-
over, this effect is specific to ILS—920, because under the same
conditions, rapamycin showed essentially no inhibition of the L—type
VGCC.

selected for in vivo study because of its lack of immunosuppression,

regeneration, and pharmacokinetic profile when compared with

WYE-592. In a transient middle cerebral artery occlusion (tM-
CAO) model of ischemic stroke, ILS—920, administered 4 h post-
occlusion at 10 and 30 mg/kg, significantly reduced infarct volume
by 24% and 23% in 72 h, respectively, (Fig. 5), as well as robustly
enhanced functional recovery measured by improvement in neu-
rological deﬁcits (data not shown). In contrast, rapamycin alone in
a similar model for stroke was reported to be devoid of efficacy (16).

Discussion

After reports that the immunosuppressant drugs FK506 and rapa-
mycin exhibit potent neuroprotective activities (1, 2), numerous
attempts to develop therapeutically useful compounds by uncou-
pling neuroprotection from immunosuppression in this class of
compounds have met with limited success. Nonimmunosuppressive
immunophilin ligands such as GPIlO46, which contains the FKBP-
binding moiety of rapamycin and FK506 but lacks an mTOR or
calcineurin binding domain, have been pursued as potential ther-
apies for neurodegenerative disorders. GPIlO46 has been reported
to stimulate neurite outgrowth in chicken sensory ganglia at pico-
molar concentrations and to stimulate recovery after sciatic nerve
crush (22). However, other reports represent the neuroprotective
activity of GPIlO46 as being marginal in neurite outgrowth studies
in chicken DRG eXplants, rat DRGs, and a sciatic nerve injury
model (23, 24). In View of these discrepancies, it was proposed
that neuroprotection is mediated by immunophilins other than

treatment with |LS-920 (P < 0.05).

FKBP12, notably FKBP52 and FKBP38 (5, 6). We therefore set out
to design and synthesize rapamycin analogs that demonstrated
substantially reduced immunosuppressive and improved neuropro-
tective activities with the aim of using the resultant compound to
determine whether immunophilin binding alone is important for
neuroprotection.

Rather than eliminating the mTOR binding domain of rapamy-
cin to generate small molecules like GPIlO46, we introduced an
additional bulky group at the rapamycin triene to disrupt mTOR
binding (15) and eliminate immunosuppressive activity. WYE-592
contains a bulky group at the mTOR binding region of rapamycin
that was installed Via a DielsiAlder reaction with nitrosobenzene.
This compound was twice as potent a promoter of cortical neuronal
survival than rapamycin and four times more potent at stimulating
neurite outgrowth (Table 1). Surprisingly, the compound exhibited
a significant (although reduced) level of immunosuppressive activ-
ity, relative to rapamycin, as measured by IL—2-stimulated T cell
proliferation. A small percentage conversion of WYE-5 92 to rapa-
mycin Via a retro DielsiAlder reaction, however, can account for
this level of activity, and indeed 3% rapamycin was observed after
72 h incubation of WYE-592 in assay buffer (data not shown).
Reduction of the C2,C3 olefin in WYE-592 Via catalytic hydroge-
nation to yield ILS—920 precluded the possibility of such a retro
DielsiAlder reaction in the product, and the compound was
observed to have no effect on T cell proliferation up to 5 1.1M.
Moreover, ILS-920 was almost ﬁve times more potent than WYE-
592 at promoting cortical neuronal survival (and therefore an order
of magnitude more potent than rapamycin). Both compounds
demonstrated greater activity in these neuronal assays than the
previously reported n0nimmun0suppressive immunophilin ligand
GPI-1046 (22724).

We further sought to determine which, if any, immunophilins
were binding partners for ILS-920 and WYE-592 and whether these
or any other n0nimmun0philin proteins might mediate the com-
pounds’ neuroprotective activities. Affinity purification from F—11
cell lysates, using resin with covalently bound WYE-592 and
ILS—920, identified FKBP52 and the Bl-subunit of L-type Ca2+
channels (CACNB1) as the major binding partners for the com-
pounds. Moreover, ILS-920 and WYE-592 demonstrated an un-
anticipated and intriguing featureibinding selectivity for FKBP5 2
over FKBP12. We have shown that FK506 and rapamycin have only
a 2- to 3-fold difference in binding affinity to FKBP12 versus
FKBP52. ILS-920 demonstrated over 200-fold selectivity for
FKBP52 versus FKBP12, representing a change in binding speci-
ﬁcity (as measured by the ratio of Kd FKBP52/Kd FKBP12) of three
orders of magnitude relative to rapamycin (Table 1). This binding
selectivity is unexpected, because X-ray structures of the isomerase
domains of FKBP12 and FKBP52 are very similar and the active site
residues have only 1 aa difference (His-87 in FKBP12 versus
Ser-118 in FKBP52) (25). It therefore is likely that in the process of
interfering with mTOR binding, the introduction of conformation-

ally constrained substitutions at the triene of rapamycin can subtly
influence the overall global population of macrolactone conformers
that in turn affects immunophilin binding selectivity, given that
rapamycin is well known to be a dynamic molecule that exists as a
set of major and minor solution conformers because of cis-trans
isomerization of the amide bond (12, 26). This report presents
evidence that modiﬁcation distant to the FKBP-binding domain of
rapamycin could generate orders of magnitude changes in immu-
nophilin binding selectivity.

Recently, FKBP52, FKBP38/Ca2T/CaM, and cyclophilin D have
been proposed as the specific mediators of the neuroprotective
action of immunophilin ligands (577). However, there is disagree-
ment as to whether a single immunophilin mediates this actiVity
and, if so, which one. FKBP52 was proposed to mediate the neurite
outgrowth action of FK506 through activation of steroid receptor
complexes that mediate downstream responses to estrogen, andro-
gen, and glucocorticoid hormones (5). An FKBP38-calmodulin—
Ca2+ complex formed at high Ca2+ concentrations recently was
proposed to mediate CaZT-overload-induced cell death through its
interaction as a negative effector of the antiapoptotic Bcl—2 protein
(6). Cyclophilin D, the Ppif gene product involved in mitochondrial
permeability transition pore assembly, also was proposed to medi-
ate Ca2+ overload and oxidative stress-induced cell death after
ischemia (7). However, ILS-920 and WYE-592 showed a strong
affinity for FKBP52 but no binding to FKBP38/Ca2T/CaM and
cyclophilin D. Together with our observation that neurite out-
growth was significantly increased in FKBP52 siRNA-treated neu-
rons, FKBP52 appears to be a principal mediator of neurite
outgrowth of WYE-592 and ILS-920, given that neurite outgrowth
of this magnitude is consistent with the reported activity of anti-
FKBP52 antibody (5).

ILS-920 and WYE-592 represent the ﬁrst immunophilin ligands
that have been shown to bind to the Bl-subunit and inhibit L-type
VGCC. L-type VGCC play a pivotal role in neuronal functioning,
because Ca2+ influx through the L-type channel regulates impor-
tant transcriptional responses such as the CaM kinase IV
(CaMKIV)-dependent pathway, mitogen—activated protein kinase
(MAPK) signaling pathway, cAMP response element binding
protein (CREB)-dependent transcription, NFAT-dependent tran-
scription, and apoptosis pathway (2731). These pathways are
known to play critical roles in synaptic plasticity, neural inflamma-
tion, developmental cell death, and neurodegenerative disorders
(2731). Because ILS—920 inhibited Ca2+ currents in the presence
of N-type blockers, but not in the presence of both L—type and
N-type blockers, we conclude that ILS-920 selectively inhibits the
L-type VGCC, although we cannot exclude the possibility that other
VGCC (such as P/Q or R) also may contribute to some lesser
degree. Moreover, this effect is specific to ILS-920, because under
the same conditions, rapamycin showed essentially no inhibition of
the L—type VGCC. It therefore is likely that attenuation of Ca2+
influx is mechanistically important for neuroprotection, because
Ca2+ overload generally is considered to be a critical event in
excitotoxic-mediated neuronal death (28).

Having prepared nonimmunosuppressive rapalogs with im-
proved neuroprotective properties, identified their binding part-
ners, and established a link between these proteins and the com-
pounds’ biological activities, we further sought to evaluate their
actiVity in an in vivo model of stroke. ILS—920 was selected as a
suitable candidate for testing based on its lack of immunosuppres-
sion, superior potency, and pharmacokinetic properties in addition
to its improved stability relative to WYE-592 (see above). Treat-
ment with ILS—920 at 10 and 30 mg/kg, administered 4 h postoc-
clusion, significantly reduced infarct volume and improved neuro-
logical recovery in a tMCAO model of ischemic stroke. The in vivo
efficacy of ILS-920 is in marked contrast to rapamycin, which failed
to reduce infarct volume in a rat tMCAO model (16). GPI—1046 also
was reported to have limited or no efﬁcacy in comparable models
of ischemic stroke (24). N-(N’,N’-dimethylcarboxamidomethyl)cy-

Ruan et al.

cloheXimide (DM-CHX) was reported to reduce infarct volume by
up to 44% when delivered Via intracerebroventricular (i.c.V.) ap-
plication 2 h postocclusion (but not 6 h) in a rat model of
endothelin-induced transient focal ischemia (6). Because i.c.V.
application is impractical for human stroke patients, in the absence
of data employing alternate routes of delivery it is unclear at present
what the clinical utility of such a compound might be. FK506 also
has been reported to protect against ischemic insult (16), although
its immunosuppressive actiVity and other off-target activities (9)
also limit the therapeutic utility of the compound. In contrast,
treatment with ILS—920 results in significant enhancement of neu-
rological recovery in a tMCAO model of stroke with at least a 4—h
therapeutic window (time elapsed between insult and initial dose)
when delivered intravenously. Interestingly, modulation of calcium
transients are implicated in both the proposed FKBP38 and cyclo-
philin D-mediated pathways of neuroprotection, as well as for the
calcineurin/calmodulin pathway inhibited by FK506. The additional
capacity of ILS—920 to promote neurite outgrowth, mediated by
binding to FKBP52, may serve to further extend the therapeutic
window of the compound beyond the acute phase of recovery from
ischemic injury. Together, our results indicate that perhaps both
FKBP52 and CaZT-channel-mediated signaling pathways are re-
quired for clinically relevant in vivo efficacy in stroke models.

In conclusion, our work presents evidence that modification of
rapamycin at the mTOR binding region can provide nonimmuno-
suppressive compounds with unanticipated selectivity for FKBP52,
inhibition of L-type Ca2+ channel currents, and significant efficacy
in an animal model of ischemic stroke. The in vivo efﬁcacy of
ILS—920 derives from the compound’s dual functions as an potential
activator of glucocorticoid and other steroid receptors Via dissoci-
ation of FKBP52 from the receptor complexes and as an inhibitor
of L-type VGCC Via binding to the Bl-subunit.

ysis of immunophilin ligands, cloning and expressing recombinant genes and
binding assays, preparation of neuronal cultures, transient MCAO, and immuno-
suppression assays) can be found in the SIMethods.

Antibodies were from Abcam (Cambridge, MA). Media, human ORF clones
(cacnb1, cacnb4, fkbp3, fkbp4, fkbp8, ppiF, and ppiD), plasmids (pDEST17),
and SuperScript system were from Invitrogen (Carlsbad, CA). Protein purifi-

Affi-Gel 10 were from BioRad (Hercules, CA).

Synthesis of WYE-592. Rapamycin (0.3 g, 0.328 mmol) was dissolved in 5 ml of
toluene with gentle heating. To this solution was added, dropwise, a solution of
nitrosobenzene (0.1 g, 3 equivalents) in 5 ml oftoluene. The reaction mixture was
stirred at 70°C for 16 h, and then the products were chromatographed via
reversed-phase HPLC (column: 250 X 20 mm YMC ODS-A with 50 X 20 guard;
mobile phase: 80 to 85% methanol:water in 40 min, flow = 20 ml/min) to yield
0.139 g of WYE-592 (42% yield, >99% purity; SI Table 2). [14C]WYE-592 (5 mCi,
specific activity 241 mCi/mmol) was prepared by a similar method.

Synthesis of lLS-920. WYE-592 (0.29 g, 0.284 mmol) was dissolved in 7 ml of
methanol in an 18-mm test tube, and a spatula tip of Pd/C catalyst (Aldrich) was
added. The mixture was hydrogenated on a Parr apparatus for 15 min at 2.0
atmosphere H2. The products were chromatographed via reversed-phase HPLC
(column: 250 X 20 mm YMC ODS-A with 50 X 20 guard, mobile phase: 80%
methanol:water for 15 min, then to 85% in 5 min, then held at 85% for 20 min,

inhibitor cocktails) was added, and its S-100 supernatant was collected after a
15-min centrifugation at 4°C. Aliquots (2 ml) were incubated with affinity ma-
trices (1007150 Ml) at 4°C. After washing with lysis buffer (2 ml) and then PBS
buffer (2 ml), beads were analyzed by SDS/PAG E. The protein bands were cut and
digested with trypsin (0.3 pug) in digestion buffer (30 MI; 0.2% NH4HC03) at 30°C.
The resulting peptides (2 MI) were loaded into a nanoelectrospray tip of a Bruker
(Billerica, MA) APEXII FT-ICR mass spectrometer equipped with an actively
shielded 9.4 T superconducting magnet (Magnex Scientific Ltd., U.K.), and an
external Bruker Apollo ESI source, and mixed with 1% formic acid in methanol (2
MI). A voltage of a 7800V was applied between the nanoelectrospray tip and the
glass capillary. The mass spectra data were externally calibrated by using HP
tuning mix and used for a Mascot search in the NCBI protein databases. Reason-
able protein candidates were selected based on confidence scores (P value). For
Western analysis, the proteins obtained from the affinity matrices were sepa-
rated by SDS/PAGE, transferred to PVDF membranes by electroblotting (100 V,
1 h), immunoblotted with the anti-CACNB1 or anti-FKBP4 antibody, and visual-
ized by 3,3’,5,5’-tetramethylbenzidine (TMB) staining.

Transient Transfection of siRNA into Primary Cortical Neurons. For each condi-
tion, 5 X 105 cortical neurons were transfected with 200 ng of scrambled siRNA
(Dharmacon RNA Technologies, Boulder, CO), siGLO lamin A/C siRNA (Dharma-
con), L-type calcium channel B1-subunit siRNA [5’-GGAGAAGUACAAUAAU-
GAC‘IT-3’ (sense) and 5’-GUCAUUAUUGUACUUCUCC‘IT-3’ (antisense)] or FKBP4
siRNA [5’-CCUAGCUAUGCUUUUGGCATT-3’ (sense)and 5’-UGCCAAAGCAUAGC-
UAGGTT-3’ (antisense)] (Ambion, Inc., Austin, TX) by using program DC-104 on
the 96-well shuttle (Amaxa Biosystems, Gaithersburg, MD). Then 25 Ml from each
transfection reaction were added to a poly(D)-lysine-coated 96-well plate (four
wells per experiment). Transfected cortical neurons were maintained in culture
for 24 h.

inhibitor mixture and phosphatase inhibitors, and protein concentrations were
measured with a Bradford assay (Bio—Rad Laboratories, Hercules, CA). Two mi-
crograms of protein per condition were loaded into each well and separated via
SDS/PAGE. Proteins were transferred onto nitrocellulose and incubated with an
antibody against lamin A/C (Upstate), CACNB1 (Abcam, Cambridge, MA), or
FKBP52 (Santa Cruz Biotech nolog)’), and actin (Sigma) as a loading control. Bands
were developed and quantified by using an Odyssey Infra red Imaging System and
Odyssey software (Li-Cor Biosciences, Lincoln, NE). Protein expression knockdown
was calculated as the ratioto actin as a percentage of scrambled siRNA expression
(79.2 : 13.7% forlamin A/C, 70.8 : 20.8% for CACNB1, and 86.8 : 7.0 for FKBP52,
n = 3).

Whole-Cell Patch-Clamp Recordings. The whole-cell configuration of the patch-
clamptechnique was used to record Ca2+ currents from cells at room temperatu re
by using an EPC—9 amplifier (HEKA InstruTECH Corp.) with the acquisition and
analysis program Pulse-PulseFit from HEKA (Lambrecht, Germany). Electrodes
were fabricated by using a P-87 puller (Sutter Instrument). Electrodes had a
resistance of 275 M0 when filled with recording solution (140 mM CsCl, 10 mM
EGTA, 10 mM Hepes, 5 mM M902, 2 mM ATP, and 1 mM CAMP, pH 7.2). The
standard bath recording solution is Ca2+- and MgZ+-free HBSS (pH 7.4) containing
10 mM Hepes, 10 mM dextrose, and 4 mM BaCIZ. Currents were filtered at 3 kHz,
and the inward Ca2+ currents were recorded from cells held at 790 mV with 10
mV depolarizing steps from 780 mV to 60 mV for 50 ms for characterization, or
to 0 mV for 50 ms (F-11) or 100 ms (neurons) once every 30 s for compound
experiments. Saturating concentrations of N-type and L-type Ca2+ channel block-
ers were used in the indicated experiments.
