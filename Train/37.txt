The kainate receptor (KAR), a subtype of glutamate receptor,
mediates excitatory synaptic responses at a subset of glutamatergic synapses. However, the molecular mechanisms underlying the
trafficking of its different subunits are poorly understood. Here
we use the CA1 hippocampal pyramidal cell, which lacks KARmediated synaptic currents, as a null background to determine the
minimal requirements for the extrasynaptic and synaptic expression of the GluK2 subunit. We find that the GluK2 receptor itself,
in contrast to GluK1, traffics to the neuronal surface and synapse
efficiently and the auxiliary subunits Neto1 and Neto2 caused no
further enhancement of these two trafficking processes. However,
the regulation of GluK2 biophysical properties by Neto proteins is
the same as that of GluK1. We further determine that it is the
amino-terminal domains (ATDs) of GluK1 and GluK2 that control
the strikingly different trafficking properties between these two
receptors. Moreover, the ATDs are critical for synaptic expression
of heteromeric receptors at mossy fiber–CA3 synapses and also
mediate the differential dependence on Neto proteins for surface
and synaptic trafficking of GluK1 and GluK2. These results highlight the fundamental differences between the two major KAR
subunits and their interplay with Neto auxiliary proteins.

synaptic trafficking
Excitatory synaptic transmission in the brain is mediated primarily
by glutamate, which acts on three types of glutamate receptors,
AMPA receptors (AMPARs), NMDA receptors (NMDARs), and
kainate receptors (KARs). AMPARs and NMDARs are expressed
at most glutamatergic synapses, whereas KARs are expressed
much more selectively at a subset of synapses. KARs are composed
of low-affinity GluK1–3 subunits and high-affinity GluK4/5 subunits (1–3). Most of our knowledge of KARs comes from studies
of excitatory mossy fiber synapses onto CA3 pyramidal cells (4).
These receptors are expressed postsynaptically and are responsible
for a slow excitatory postsynaptic current (EPSC) (5, 6). They are
also expressed presynaptically and contribute to the profound
frequency facilitation of these synapses (7–10). In the CA1 region,
excitatory synapses onto pyramidal cells do not generate KARmediated currents (5, 11, 12), but, interestingly, functional
GluK2-containing receptors are expressed on the surface of CA1
pyramidal cells (11). These findings raise the question as to what
determines the synaptic expression of KARs.
Recently it has been discovered that Neto proteins serve as
auxiliary subunits for KARs (13–15). They are neuropilin and tolloid-like proteins that are single pass transmembrane CUB domaincontaining proteins. Although Neto1 and Neto2 have profound
effects on the trafficking and kinetics of GluK1 (16–20), their effects
on GluK2 are less clear. Neto2 slows deactivation (14) as well as
desensitization of GluK2 (14, 18) and has similar effects on GluK2/5
receptors (19). Neto1 also slows desensitization of GluK2 receptors
(18) and slows desensitization of GluK2/5 receptors (20, 21) as well
as deactivation (21). In contrast to the dramatic effects that Neto
proteins have on the kinetics of GluK2-containing receptors, their
roles in trafficking of these receptors are less clear. Most studies
find no effect of Neto1 or Neto2 on the surface expression of
GluK2 (14, 21). On the other hand, Palacios-Filardo et al. reported
that both Neto1 and Neto2 increased surface expression (18).
In the present study, we have used the excitatory synapses onto
CA1 pyramidal cells, which do not express KARs, to study the
properties of the GluK2 receptor and the effects of Neto proteins
on this receptor. We recently found that GluK1, in the absence of
Neto proteins, is poorly expressed on the neuronal surface and
does not appear at synapses (16). However, in the presence of
either Neto1 or Neto2, the surface expression of GluK1 is extremely high and the receptor is targeted to the synapse. Neto
proteins also affect the rate of GluK1’s desensitization, and Neto1,
but not Neto2, slows the rate of its deactivation. Here we show
that GluK2, on its own, is expressed on the surface at high levels,
equivalent to GluK1 coexpressed with Neto proteins. Neto proteins have no effect on surface or synaptic expression of GluK2.
However, in outside-out patches, Neto1 and Neto2 have the
identical effects on deactivation and desensitization of GluK2, as
they do on GluK1. We find that the profound difference in the
surface trafficking of GluK1 and GluK2 resides in the aminoterminal domain (ATD) and the GluK2 ATD is also critical for
the targeting of GluK2/5 heteromeric receptors to mossy fiber–
CA3 synapses. Moreover, the ATDs of GluK1 and GluK2 control
their differential dependence on Neto proteins for extrasynaptic
and synaptic trafficking. Taken together, these results demonstrate
Significance
The kainate receptor (KAR) is a subfamily of glutamate receptors that mediates excitatory synaptic transmission in the
central nervous system. GluK1 and GluK2 are two obligatory
KAR subunits and their trafficking properties are quite different; however, the underlying molecular mechanism remains a
mystery. Here we show that GluK2 receptor trafficking is independent on Neto auxiliary subunits, whereas the regulation
of its biophysical properties by Neto proteins is the same as
that of GluK1. Moreover, we show that it is the amino-terminal
domains (ATDs) of GluK1 and GluK2 that determine their distinct trafficking performance and mediate their different dependence on Neto proteins for trafficking.

Results
GluK2 Receptor Targets to Excitatory Synapse on Its Own. For this study,
we used organotypic rat hippocampal slices and exogenously
expressed KARs and Neto proteins through biolistic transfection in
CA1 neurons, which are devoid of KAR-mediated synaptic responses (5, 11, 12), and then measured the synaptic responses of
transfected and neighboring wild-type CA1 neurons by dual wholecell recordings (Fig. S1A). In agreement with our previous results
(16), expression of GluK1, by itself, failed to affect synaptic currents
(Fig. 1A). However, expression of GluK2, by itself, caused a profound enhancement of the evoked EPSC (eEPSC) recorded at
−70 mV and some of this current remained in the presence of the
AMPAR selective antagonist GYKI53655 (Fig. 1B). It should be
noted that a high concentration of GYKI53655 (100 μM), which
blocks ∼20–30% of KAR-mediated responses (22), was used to
ensure that the remaining currents are, indeed, solely KAR mediated. And in the absence of a specific GluK2 antagonist, currently,
we could not rule out the possibility that GluK2 expression leads to
additional recruitment of synaptic AMPARs. This result suggests
that the lack of KAR-mediated synaptic response in CA1 neurons
might be due to the limited endogenous expression of GluK2 receptor, although some functional GluK2-containing receptors are
found on the cell surface (11). Interestingly, there was also a significant enhancement of the NMDAR currents (Fig. S2B) in
GluK2-expressing cells, which raises the possibility of a synaptogenic
effect. Although presynaptic KARs are known to regulate glutamate release at mossy fibers, sparse expression of GluK1 or GluK2
receptors in CA1 neurons had no effect on presynaptic release
probability as there were no significant changes of paired-pulse
ratios (GluK1 vs. control: 1.51 ± 0.12 vs. 1.50 ± 0.09, P > 0.05;
GluK2 vs. control: 1.28 ± 0.13 vs. 1.11 ± 0.05, P > 0.05). We next
examined the possibility that activity played a role in the GluK2-
induced enhancement. The experiments were repeated in the
presence of the following drugs during culture: the AMPAR antagonist NBQX and the NMDAR antagonist APV (Fig. S3A), the
sodium channel blocker tetrodotoxin (TTX) (Fig. S3B) or the calcium channel blocker nifedipine (Fig. S3C). None of these manipulations prevented the enhancement, either of the AMPAR/KAR
or NMDAR responses.
There are a number of possible mechanisms by which GluK2 enhances synaptic transmission. First, receptors could selectively populate silent synapses as is the case for the expression of GluK1 (16).
Second, they could colocalize with synaptic AMPARs. However, it
seems unlikely that these two mechanisms could fully account for the
magnitude of the enhancement. One additional possibility is that new
synapses are formed. To test these various possibilities, we examined
the effect of GluK2 expression on the properties of miniature EPSCs
(mEPSCs) (Fig. S4A). Both the amplitude (Fig. S4 B, 1 and 2) and
the frequency (Fig. S4 C, 1 and 2) of mEPSCs were increased in
cells expressing GluK2 compared with neighboring control cells.
In addition, there was a dramatic speeding in the decay of the
mEPSCs (Fig. S4 D, 1 and 2). Application of GYKI53655 (30 μM)
completely blocked the AMPAR-mediated mEPSCs in the control
cells, as expected (Fig. S4 A, E, and F), but had a minor effect on
the mEPSCs in the GluK2-expressing cells (Fig. S4 E and F), indicating that a large majority of events in the expressing cells are
mediated by KARs. We selected a concentration of GYKI53655
(30 μM) that was just sufficient to entirely block responses in
control cells and thus minimize the blocking of KAR-mediated
mEPSCs. We next examined whether the large GluK2-mediated
mEPSCs also contained an AMPAR component. For this analysis,
we used a detection threshold of 40 pAs (Fig. S4 G, 1) so we were
assured that the events were larger than the AMPAR-mediated
mEPSCs in the control cells. If the large events contained an
AMPAR component, then we would expect that GYKI53655
should cause a substantial reduction in the amplitude of these
large events and an acceleration of the decay of the mEPSCs.
Surprisingly, we saw minimal effect on the amplitude (Fig. S4E)
and no effect on the decay (Fig. S4 G, 2), suggesting that there is
no colocalization of AMPARs at the GluK2-expressing synapses.
To determine whether there were any neuronal structural
modifications that accompanied the profound effects of GluK2
expression, we imaged the dendritic spines as a proxy for the
number of excitatory synapses. Remarkably, expression of GluK2
had no effect on spine density (Fig. S2D). It did reduce the diameter of the spine neck (Fig. S2 E, 1 and 2) and spine head
(Fig. S2 G, 1 and 2), whereas increasing the length of the spine
shaft (Fig. S2 F, 1 and 2). However, none of these anatomical
changes can account for the large GluK2 effects. To account for
the large increase in mEPSC frequency (Fig. S4 C, 1 and 2) and
the increase in the NMDAR comment of the eEPSC (Fig. S4B),
we suggest that the additional synapses are preferentially made
on dendritic shafts.
Neto Proteins Do Not Regulate GluK2 Receptor Extrasynaptic and
Synaptic Trafficking. The coexpression of Neto1 or Neto2 with
GluK1 has a profound effect on surface and synaptic expression,
as well as the kinetics of GluK1-mediated responses (16). In
striking contrast, neither Neto1 nor Neto2 had any effect on the
enhancement of synaptic responses caused by GluK2 (Fig. S5).
However, we were concerned that the massive enhancement
caused by the expression of GluK2 might obscure any effects that
the Neto proteins might have on GluK2. We therefore lowered
the expression of GluK2 by expressing it after an internal ribosome entry site (IRES). This substantially reduced the magnitude of the enhancement (Fig. 2A). However, neither the
coexpression of Neto1 (Fig. 2 B and D) nor the coexpression of
Fig. 1. Synaptic responses are potentiated by GluK2 but not GluK1 receptors in CA1 pyramidal neurons. Rat hippocampal slice cultures were biolistically
transfected with GluK1 (A, n = 12) or GluK2 (B, n = 12). Simultaneous dual whole-cell recordings from a transfected CA1 pyramidal neuron (green trace) and a
neighboring wild-type one (black trace) were performed. The evoked EPSCs (eEPSCs) were measured at −70 mV before and after GYKI53655 (100 μM)
treatment. Open and filled circles represent amplitudes for single pairs and mean ± SEM, respectively. Insets show sample current traces from control (black)
and experimental (green) cells. (Scale bars, 100 pA and 25 ms.) Bar graphs show normalized eEPSC amplitudes (mean ± SEM) of −70 mV pretreatment

0.001) presented in scatter plots. The eEPSC amplitudes measured at −70 mV after GYKI53655 wash-in in A and B were normalized according to respective
pretreated control neurons. All of the statistical analyses are compared with respective control neurons with two-tailed Wilcoxon signed-rank sum test.

Neto2 (Fig. 2 C and D) had any effect on the enhancement of the
AMPAR/KAR-mediated eEPSCs and the NMDAR-mediated
eEPSCs (Fig. S6). Because the trafficking of GluK2 is independent of Neto proteins, the lack of synaptic targeting of endogenous
GluK2 cannot be related to these auxiliary proteins. Furthermore,
unlike GluK1 (16), Neto1 and Neto2 had no effect on the size of
the GluK2-mediated currents in outside-out patches (Fig. 2 E, 1).
Neto1 and Neto2 did affect the kinetics of GluK2 currents
obtained from outside-out patches and ultrafast glutamate application. These experiments were done in the presence of GYKI53655
(100 μM) to ensure that GluK2 was fully responsible for the
recorded currents. Neto1 had no effect on deactivation, whereas
Neto2 slowed deactivation (Fig. 2 E, 2). Neto1 hastened the onset of
desensitization in contrast to Neto2, which slowed the rate of desensitization (Fig. 2 E, 3). All of the effects of Neto1 and Neto2 on
the kinetics of GluK2 are the same as that for GluK1 receptor (16).
We also recorded the effects of Neto proteins on the decay of
isolated KAR-mediated mEPSCs (Fig. 2F) in the presence of
GYKI53655 (30 μM). Neto1 had no effect, as would be expected,
because it did not affect deactivation, whereas Neto2 slowed the
decay of mEPSCs, presumably by its slowing of deactivation. All of
the results indicate that Neto auxiliary subunits have no regulation
of the surface and synaptic trafficking of GluK2, but regulate the
receptor’s biophysical properties.
The ATDs Are the Critical Determinants for GluK1 and GluK2 Differential
Synaptic Trafficking. What could account for the finding that expression of GluK1 had no effect on synaptic transmission, whereas
GluK2 caused a more than 10-fold increase? Previous studies have
already indicated the importance of the intracellular C-terminal
domain (CTD) for KARs trafficking. It has been found that there is
an ER retention and retrieval motif in GluK1 CTD, thereby limiting
the surface expression of this homomeric receptor (23, 24) and
GluK2 CTD possesses a forward-trafficking signal for its ER exit
(25). Therefore, we first examined the effects of the KAR CTD on
synaptic expression by swapping the CTDs between GluK1 and
GluK2 (Fig. 3). The GluK2 CTD had a modest but significant effect
on GluK1 synaptic expression (Fig. 3 A and G). Although the enhancement of synaptic responses by the GluK2 mutants, either
GluK2(CTDK1) (GluK2 replaced with the CTD of GluK1) or
GluK2(ΔCTD) (GluK2 lacking its CTD), were slightly but significant less than wild-type GluK2, the two mutants still trafficked to
synapses very efficiently (Fig. 3 B and G). All these results suggest
that GluK2 CTD might not be the major determinant for the receptor’s synaptic targeting. We next replaced the entire extracellular
domain of GluK1 with that of GluK2, and surprisingly the GluK2
extracellular domain delivered GluK1 receptors to synapses very
efficiently and this GluK1(NK2) mutant almost phenocopied wildtype GluK2 (Fig. 3 C and G). More specifically, the enhancement
caused by the extracellular domain of GluK2 resides in the ATD
(Fig. 3 E and G). Consistent with these results, the presence of the
extracellular domain [GluK2(NK1), Fig. 3 D and G] or the ATD
[GluK2(ATDK1), Fig. 3 F and G] of GluK1 on GluK2 failed to
increase synaptic transmission and phenocopied wild-type GluK1,
suggesting it is the ATDs that account for the differential GluK1
and GluK2 synaptic trafficking. Moreover, we also found that the
GluK1(ATDK2) indeed significantly increased the synaptic currents mediated by NMDARs, the same as GluK2. However,
GluK2(ATDK1) had no effect on NMDAR-mediated synaptic responses, the same as GluK1 (Fig. S7), indicating that the GluK2-
regulated enhancement of synaptic responses mediated by
NMDARs is dependent on the ATD of GluK2.
For our above studies, we have taken advantage of the absence
of KAR synaptic currents at the Schaffer collateral–CA1 synapse
to characterize the basic properties of KARs. Can we apply these
findings to a synapse that normally expresses KAR-mediated
currents? We were specifically interested in the role of the ATD of
low-affinity subunits GluK1 and GluK2 for the synaptic trafficking
of native KARs. For this purpose we turned to the mossy fiber–
CA3 synapse. Based on an elegant series of genetic studies, it has
been found that KARs at mossy fiber synapses are heteromers
consisting of GluK2 (26) and the high-affinity subunits GluK4/5
Fig. 2. The auxiliary Neto1 and Neto2 proteins regulate the biophysical
properties of GluK2 receptor but have no effect on GluK2 surface and synaptic
trafficking. (A–C) The same experimental design as in Fig. 1 except that EGFPIRES-GluK2 (A), Neto1-IRES-GluK2 (B), and Neto2-IRES-GluK2 (C) were used for

(27). For these experiments, we expressed GluK5 before the IRES
and GluK2 after the IRES. This would result in an excess of GluK5
expression compared with GluK2. Because GluK5 does not form
functional homomeric receptors, it ensures that any increased currents recorded will consist of GluK2/5 heteromers. We carried out
simultaneous whole-cell recordings from experimental and neighboring wild-type CA3 neurons in the presence of GYKI53655 and
stimulated the mossy fibers locally (Fig. S1B). Expression of GluK2/5
resulted in a large enhancement of the slow EPSCs (Fig. 4 A and E),
indicating that the mossy fiber synapses can accommodate additional
GluK2/5 receptors. In contrast, expression of GluK1 with GluK5,
which can form heteromeric receptors (28, 29), had no effect on the
slow EPSCs (Fig. 4 B and E). When the ATD of GluK1 was placed
on the GluK2 subunit the slow EPSCs was only modestly increased
(Fig. 4 C and E), suggesting that the ATD of GluK2 is important for
the synaptic targeting of heteromeric KARs. Indeed, the chimera
mutant GluK1 containing the ATD of GluK2 [GluK1(ATDK2)]
substantially increased the slow EPSCs (Fig. 4 D and E).
The ATDs of GluK1 and GluK2 Are Critical for Their Differential Trafficking
Regulated by Neto Proteins. We were curious as to how the coexpression of Neto proteins with GluK1 phenocopied the wild-type
GluK2 on its own (16), whereas these auxiliary subunits cause no
enhancement of GluK2 synaptic trafficking (Fig. 2 and Fig. S5). To
test the possibility that the ATDs of GluK1 and GluK2 might be
involved in this differential regulation, we coexpressed either Neto1
or Neto2 with the GluK1 chimera in which the ATD is replaced
with the GluK2’s, named GluK1(ATDK2), which traffics to synapses efficiently (Fig. 3 E and G), and found that neither caused any
further enhancement of synaptic currents (Fig. 5 A–C). However,
coexpression of Neto1 or Neto2 with the GluK2 chimera containing
the GluK1 ATD [GluK2(ATDK1)], which failed to target to the
CA1 synapses on its own (Fig. 3 F and G), significantly rescued
synaptic potentiation (Fig. 5 D–F). These results indicate that it is
the ATDs of GluK1 and GluK2 that control their differential dependence on Neto proteins for synaptic trafficking.
Is the ATD of GluK2 necessary for delivery of the receptor to the
surface and/or is it responsible for the targeting of surface receptors
to the synapse? To address this question, we recorded extrasynaptic
currents in the presence of GYKI53655 (100 μM) from outside-out
somatic patches and used ultrafast glutamate application, because
KARs desensitize extremely rapidly. The magnitude of the currents
for the various chimeras generally correlated with the magnitude of
their synaptic currents. Specifically, the marginal surface expression
of GluK2(ATDK1) on its own was similar to that of GluK1,
whereas the ATD of GluK2 delivered the GluK1(ATDK2) mutated
receptors to the surface efficiently without Neto proteins (Fig. 5G),
suggesting that the ATDs of GluK1 and GluK2 are also critical for
these receptors’ surface expression. Moreover, coexpression of
Neto2 had virtually the same enhancing effect on GluK1 and
GluK2(ATDK1) (Fig. 5G), implying that the Neto interaction with
the GluK1 ATD is essential for the surface expression of GluK1.
On the other hand, Neto2 failed to further increase the magnitude
of GluK1(ATDK2)-mediated enhancement (Fig. 5G), which is
similar to the regulation of GluK2 by Neto proteins (Fig. 2 E, 1).
Taken together, these results suggest that the ATDs of GluK1 and
GluK2 interplay with auxiliary Neto proteins, regulating the KARs’
surface and synaptic trafficking.

Discussion
In this study, we first used the hippocampal CA1 pyramidal neuron
as a null background system to study the mechanism regulating the
trafficking of KARs because the Schaffer collateral–CA1 synapses
lack KAR expression. We find that unlike GluK1, which requires
the auxiliary subunits Neto1 and Neto2 for surface and synaptic
trafficking (16, 17), GluK2 extrasynaptic and synaptic trafficking is
independent of Neto proteins. However, its proper synaptic targeting requires the extracellular ATD region. At the mossy fiber–
CA3 synapses, which do express KARs, we find that the GluK2
ATD is also critical for the synaptic targeting of GluK2/GluK5
heteromeric receptor complexes. Furthermore, we determine that it
is the ATDs of GluK1 and GluK2 contributing their differential
dependence on Neto proteins for surface and synaptic trafficking.
Our results demonstrate the important role of the interplay of the
KAR ATDs and the Neto auxiliary subunits in controlling the
surface expression and synaptic incorporation of kainate receptors.
Consistent with our previous study (16), expressing GluK1 in
CA1 pyramidal neurons results in very few KAR synaptic and
surface currents. We interpret this finding as a defect in the forward
trafficking of GluK1, although it is formally possible that the removal of surface receptors is greatly enhanced. By contrast, the
expression of GluK2 generates huge responses from outside-out
patches from the cell body membrane as well as the evoked EPSCs.
These differences cannot be explained by the biophysical properties
between GluK1 and GluK2 receptors because the rates of their
desensitization or deactivation kinetics are very similar (16). Thus,
the trafficking properties of GluK1 and GluK2 are fundamentally
different. This finding is consistent with a previous study showing
that the surface staining intensity of GluK2 is much higher than
GluK1 when expressed in COS-7 or primary cultured hippocampal
neurons (23). We also find that when coexpressing GluK5 with
GluK1 or GluK2 in CA3 cells, the GluK2/GluK5 but not the
GluK1/GluK5 heteromeric receptors can target to the mossy fiber–
CA3 synapses, suggesting that the low-affinity KARs may also be
critical for the expression and localization of the heteromeric receptors. The different trafficking abilities of KARs are presumably
due to their different amino acid sequences (30, 31). Several studies
have already shown the importance of the CTDs of KARs for
surface trafficking (23–25, 32, 33), and thus we first examined the
effects on synaptic expression by swapping the CTDs between
GluK1 and GluK2. Much to our surprise, we found that the enhancement of synaptic responses mediated by the GluK2(CTDK1)
or GluK2(ΔCTD) mutated receptor is similar to that seen with the
wild-type GluK2 receptor. There are several possible reasons underlying the difference between our present observation and previous studies. First, many of the previous experiments (25, 33) were
carried out in heterologous expression systems in which the regulation of GluK2 trafficking may differ from that in neurons. Consistent with this proposal, it has been reported that in COS-7 cells
GluK2a, the splicing isoform with a long CTD and used in our
current studies, traffics to the cell membrane more effectively than
the shorter isoform GluK2b (23). However, the same study reported
that the surface expression of the two isoforms is similar in primary
cultured neurons (23). Second, Yan et al. (25) used a GluK2 mutant
containing a GFP tag in the ATD. Given the critical role we have
found for the ATD of GluK2 in trafficking, it is possible that the tag
may have masked the role of the ATD of GluK2, allowing the role
of the CTD to be dissected. Consistent with this hypothesis, we
previously found that the synaptic expression of N-terminal HA or
Myc tagged-GluK1 is impaired even in the presence of Neto proteins, although they could traffic to the surface successfully (16).
The knockin studies by Straub et al. (33) suggest that the GluK2
CTD stabilizes the receptor at synapses and in agreement we also
find that the GluK2 CTD endows GluK1 with the ability to express
at synapses. Given that the CTD is not critical for GluK2 synaptic
trafficking, we focused on the extracellular domains of GluK2.
Surprisingly, swapping the entire extracellular domains or just
ATDs between GluK1 and GluK2 fully switches their surface and
synaptic trafficking abilities. Furthermore, we show here that the
ATDs of GluK1 and GluK2 determine their differential dependence on auxiliary Neto proteins for trafficking. All these results
indicate that the ATDs of GluK1 and GluK2 receptors are the
major determinant for their trafficking. Recently two studies have
revealed that C1q-like proteins interact with the ATD of GluK2 or
GluK4 to organize the KARs at mossy fiber–CA3 synapses (33, 34),
and in accordance, we also find that the ATD of GluK2 is critical
for the synaptic expression of GluK2/GluK5 heteromeric receptors
at mossy fiber–CA3 synapses.
In contrast to GluK1 (16), GluK2 surface and synaptic expression are independent on the auxiliary subunits Neto1 and
Neto2. A similar conclusion was reached in previous studies
showing that Neto2 has no effect on GluK2 trafficking in oocytes

(14) but does promote GluK1 surface expression in HEK cells and
primary cultured neurons (17). However, the underlying molecular
mechanism remains unknown. This differential dependence on
auxiliary subunits for trafficking could not be explained by any
specific interaction between GluK1 and Neto proteins because we
find that the biophysical effects of Neto proteins on GluK1 and
GluK2 are the same (16). Moreover, the decay of GluK2 mEPSCs
is increased by coexpressed Neto2. All these results indicate that
GluK2 and Neto proteins indeed interact at both the surface and the
synapse. It has been reported that it is the extracellular CUB domains of Neto1 and Neto2 that mediate their interaction with GluK2
(35), but it is unknown how they bind to GluK1 or which domains of
GluK1 and GluK2 mediate their interactions with Neto proteins.
Additionally, it has been reported that the extracellular LDLa domain of the Neto proteins is critical for their effects on GluK2 desensitization, but the intracellular C-terminal domain is critical for
their regulation of GluK2 rectification (36), indicating that Neto
proteins can regulate KAR function through different domains. We
report here that the ATDs of GluK1 and GluK2 mediate the differential dependence on Neto proteins for trafficking. It will be of
interest to identify the detailed structural and molecular basis for the
difference. Importantly, in the central nervous system, most native
KARs are heteromeric complexes and the presence of high-affinity
subunits could affect the function of Neto proteins. Such a scenario
might explain our finding that Neto2 but not Neto1 slows homomeric GluK2 mEPSC decay time, whereas previous studies indicate
that Neto1 but not Neto2 is critical for the decay of the slow EPSC
at mossy fiber–CA3 synapses (21, 35). It would be of interest to study
further the effects of Neto proteins on the trafficking and biophysical properties of specific heteromeric KAR complexes.
In summary, this study has characterized the critical role of the
ATD for KAR trafficking in hippocampal neurons as well as their
interplay with auxiliary subunit Neto proteins in this process. We
first selected the Schaffer collateral–CA1 synapse that normally
does not express KARs, to determine the minimal requirements
that govern the insertion of KARs into excitatory synapses, and
further confirm the findings at mossy fiber–CA3 synapses that
express heteromeric KARs. Our results demonstrate the critical
role of the extracellular ATD for KAR surface and synaptic expression as well as their contribution to KARs’ differential dependence on Neto proteins for trafficking.
