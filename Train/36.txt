Imaging, electrophysiological, and lesion studies have shown a relationship between the parahippocampal cortex (PHC) and the processing of
spatial scenes. Our present knowledge of PHC, however, is restricted to
the macroscopic properties and dynamics of bulk tissue; the behavior
and selectivity of single parahippocampal neurons remains largely
unknown. In this study, we analyzed responses from 630 parahippocampal neurons in 24 neurosurgical patients during visual stimulus
presentation. We found a spatially clustered subpopulation of sceneselective units with an associated event-related field potential. These
units form a population code that is more distributed for scenes than
for other stimulus categories, and less sparse than elsewhere in the
medial temporal lobe. Our electrophysiological findings provide
insight into how individual units give rise to the population response
observed with functional imaging in the parahippocampal place area.
electrophysiology | single units | scene selectivity | population code
The involvement of posterior parahippocampal cortex (PHC)
in perceiving landmarks and scenes is well established. Studies
using fMRI and intracranial electroencephalography (iEEG)
have demonstrated that a region in posterior PHC exhibits significantly greater activation to passively viewed scenes and landscapes than to single objects or faces (1, 2). Moreover, damage to
posterior PHC produces anterograde disorientation, a deficit in
the ability to navigate in novel environments (3, 4), and electrical
stimulation in this area produces complex topographic visual
hallucinations (5). Beyond gross scene-selectivity, other studies
suggested that the parahippocampal place area (PPA) responds
more strongly to outdoor scenes (1), to images of objects with a
spatial background (6), to objects that are larger in the real world
regardless of retinotopic size (7–9), and to images with greater
perceived depth (10, 11). However, as a voxel in a typical fMRI
study corresponds to several cubic millimeters of cortex, and as
iEEG contacts record the activity of large numbers of neurons,
our present knowledge of PHC is restricted to the properties
and dynamics of bulk tissue properties (12). The selectivity of
single parahippocampal neurons thus remains largely unknown.
In this work we set out to investigate the single neuron responses underlying these results. At least three different, although not necessarily mutually exclusive, types of single neuron
selectivity profiles could potentially produce the scene-selective population response observed with fMRI and iEEG recordings. First,
units could exhibit sparse responses, each of them tuned to one or
relatively few individual scenes, similar to the semantically invariant
neurons observed in the human medial temporal lobe that fire selectively to specific familiar individuals (13). In this case, the sceneselective responses observed with fMRI and iEEG would be given by
the spatial average of neurons with different responses. Second, each
unit could be scene-selective, but respond to many scenes, thus representing a distributed code, as found in macaque face and scene
patches (14, 15). Third, units might represent a low-level feature or
conjunction of features present in both scene and nonscene stimuli,
but more prevalent in the former, such that population activity to
scenes exceeds that to nonscenes. In this scenario, strong scene selectivity would be present at the population level, but single neurons
would be only weakly scene-selective. Neurocomputational
models of PHC function are scarce (16, 17) and do not make
specific predictions about the sparseness of neuronal scene responses. By analyzing the responses of single neurons in PHC to
visual stimuli in subjects with pharmacologically intractable epilepsy,
we sought to determine how viewing pictures of scenes modulated
spiking responses of individual parahippocampal neurons.
Results
We recorded a total of 1,998 units (668 single and 1,330 multiunits) (Table S1) from the hippocampus (829 single and multiunits), entorhinal cortex (EC; 539 units), and PHC (630 units)
of 24 neurosurgical patients undergoing epilepsy monitoring
while they viewed images on an LCD monitor. Stimulus sets
contained images of persons, animals, and landscapes (with and
without buildings; Materials and Methods).
PHC Neurons Respond to Landscapes and Scenes. Although neurons
in EC and hippocampus showed little consistent preference for
any particular stimulus category, neurons in PHC responded
strongly to landscapes (Figs. 1 and 2 and Fig. S1). To statistically
compare neuronal selectivity across regions and categories, we
Significance
Neurons in the human parahippocampal cortex explicitly code
for scenes, rather than people, animals, or objects. More specifically, they respond to outdoor pictures, rather than to indoor
pictures, and to stimuli with rather than without spatial layout.
These scene-selective neurons are spatially clustered and receive
spatially clustered inputs reflected by an event-related local field
potential (LFP). Furthermore, these neurons form a distributed
population code that is less sparse than codes found elsewhere
in the human medial temporal lobe. Our findings thus provide
insight into the electrophysiological (single unit and LFP) substrates underlying the parahippocampal place area, a structure
well-known from neuroimaging.

calculated the mean baseline-normalized response magnitude of
every neuron to each stimulus category. Comparison of the mean
response to different stimulus categories in the three MTL regions showed a highly significant category selectivity in the PHC
(P < 10−12, repeated-measures one-way ANOVA). Landscapes
evoked a significantly stronger response than persons (P < 10−9
,
paired t test) or animals (P = 0.0003; Fig. 3A and Fig. S2A).
Furthermore, outdoor photographs evoked a significantly
stronger response than indoor photographs (Fig. S2B), even after excluding landscape stimuli, which consisted exclusively of
outdoor photographs (Fig. 3B; P < 10−9
). In addition, all stimuli
were divided into groups with and without cues of spatial layout
(Fig. 3C, Fig. S2C, and Materials and Methods), subsequently
referred to as scenes and nonscenes, respectively. Within both
outdoor and indoor categories (excluding landscapes), the PHC
neurons responded more strongly to scenes than to nonscenes
(outdoor: P < 10−5
; indoor: P < 10−6
, paired t test).
We ran an additional series of analyses to investigate relationships between response magnitude and stimulus content. We
divided images into three categories: no background present,
background present but unrecognizable, and background clearly
visible. The responses of parahippocampal neurons to images of
persons and animals with a recognizable background were significantly stronger than the responses to images with no background or an unrecognizable background (vs. no background:
P < 10−10; vs. unrecognizable background: P < 10−6
, paired t test;
Fig. S3 A and B), but there was only a minor difference between
images with no background and images with an unrecognizable
background (P = 0.02).
Among images with a recognizable background, images with
greater perceived depth (i.e., with more spatial information)
evoked a stronger response. We obtained a rank ordering of the
real-world distance between the closest and farthest points of images with a recognizable background from 21 nonpatient subjects,
using a merge sort procedure (Materials and Methods). For each
PHC neuron, we computed the Spearman correlation between the
average rankings of the images and the corresponding firing rates
and compared the mean of the Fisher-z transformed correlation
coefficients against zero with a t test. The relationship between
depth and firing rate was highly significant [P < 10−5
; ρ = 0.060
(95% confidence interval [CI], 0.035–0.084)] and remained significant when including only persons and animals [P = 0.001; ρ =
0.038 (95% CI 0.018–0.057)].
PHC Responses Are Not Explained by Low-Level Features. The above
analyses indicate that parahippocampal neurons showed strong selectivity for images with greater indications of spatial layout. It is,
however, possible that such selectivity could be driven by selectivity
for low-level features that were more commonly present in images
with spatial layout. To rule out this possibility, we trained a linear
support vector machine (SVM) classifier to discriminate images with
and without spatial layout based on low-level visual features, using the
hierarchical model and X complex 1 (HMAX C1) layer, which is
intended to model neural representation at the level of V1 with additional scale invariance (18). For each stimulus, we obtained a
specific label for the stimulus, using a classifier trained on the
remaining stimuli. This procedure was 89% accurate at reproducing
our manual labels, correctly identifying 93% of nonscenes and 71%
of scenes. We then computed the mean responses for each of the 630
recorded single and multiunits in PHC for stimuli within four categories: stimuli manually labeled as nonscenes that the classifier also
classified as nonscenes (true negatives), stimuli manually labeled as
nonscenes that the classifier classified as scenes (false positives),
stimuli manually labeled as scenes that the classifier also labeled as
scenes (true positives), and stimuli manually labeled as scenes that the
classifier labeled as nonscenes (false negatives).
If neurons were more strongly tuned to low-level features than
to the presence or absence of spatial layout, we would expect that
nonscenes that the classifier incorrectly classified as scenes (false
positives) should elicit high response magnitude, whereas scenes
that the classifier incorrectly classified as nonscenes (false negatives) should elicit low response magnitude. This was not the case.
Instead, false negatives elicited significantly stronger responses
than false positives (P < 10−5
, paired t test; Fig. S3C). Nonscenes
elicited similar responses regardless of the classifier output (P =
0.14), although scenes classified as scenes elicited a slightly

(scenes) elicited robust responses, whereas stimuli without indications of spatial

stronger response than scenes classified as nonscenes (P =
0.002). Thus, although low-level features may account for some of
the scene responsiveness, this analysis indicates that the presence or
absence of spatial layout is the primary factor determining the response of parahippocampal neurons. This is furthermore supported
by an analysis showing that PHC responses are conditionally independent of the low-level features, given the stimulus category
(scene vs. nonscene), as shown in Fig. S4. In addition, the identity of
individual landscape stimuli can be decoded from PHC neurons
more accurately than from neurons in EC or hippocampus (Fig. S5).
Neurons Respond Faster to Landscapes. On average, PHC neurons
responded faster to scenes than to nonscenes. A latency measure
could be computed for 217 PHC single and multiunits (SI Materials and Methods). In the 121 units responding to at least one
scene, the average response latency to scenes was 300 ms, which
was significantly faster than the average response latency of 334
ms to persons and animals in the 185 PHC single and multiunits
that responded to at least one person or animal (P < 0.001, independent samples unequal variance t test). Among the 89
single and multiunits that responded both to landscapes and to
other stimulus categories, the response to landscapes was significantly faster (median difference = 15.8 ± 7.1 ms; P = 0.03,
paired samples t test).
Neuronal Scene Responses in the PHC Are Spatially Clustered. The
local field potential (LFP) measures the global activity of neuronal processes around the electrode tip (19, 20). Thus, an
electrode located in a scene-selective region can measure a sceneselective LFP. LFPs from 28% (130/472) of PHC microelectrodes
showed a significantly different response to images with and
without spatial layout (significance threshold, α = 0.01; t test). A
significant difference was also visible in the average LFP across all
electrodes (Fig. 3D and Fig. S6), with an onset of selectivity around
153 ms and peaking at 243 ms. Of the 168 single and multiunits
recorded on these 130 microelectrodes, 43% (n = 73) were also
scene-selective (individual units: α = 0.01, Mann–Whitney U test;
population: P < 10−6
, permutation test; SI Materials and Methods;
chance median, 19%). Of the 630 PHC single and multiunits, 119
showed a significant category distinction between average responses to scenes and nonscenes (α = 0.01, Mann–Whitney U test;
Fig. S7). Of these, 61% (n = 73) single and multiunits were located
on microelectrodes with a scene-selective LFP (P < 10−6
, permutation test; chance median, 28%; Fig. S8). In addition, microwire
bundles that showed a scene-selective unit on one of the eight
microwires had a significantly increased probability of having
scene-selective units on the remaining wires (P < 10−6
, permutation
test; SI Materials and Methods). These results indicate that sceneselective units as well as input signals (LFP) are spatially clustered
within subjects, consistent with fMRI selectivity for scenes. Across
subjects, no spatial clustering of scene-selective microwire bundles
was observed (Fig. S9), which is in line with the interindividual
variability of the PPA observed in fMRI studies.
Neuronal Scene Responses in the PHC Form a Distributed Code. Units
that responded to at least one scene often responded to multiple
scenes. A total of 176 (28%) of the 630 PHC single and multiunits responded to at least one image with spatial layout (scene).
In comparison, on average, 106.6 of 630 PHC units (17%)
responded to at least one image without spatial layout (nonscene) when randomly drawing a set of nonscene stimuli equal to
the number of scene stimuli (P < 10−6
, permutation test; Materials and Methods). Of the 176 scene-responsive units, 49 (28%)
responded to at least 25% of scenes (Fig. 4A); in contrast, of the
106.6 units responsive to nonscenes, on average, only 8.3 (7.8%)
responded to at least 25% of a matched number of nonscenes

COGNITIVE SCIENCES
(P < 10−6
). A comparable effect was present when only single
units were included in the analysis (Fig. 4B): of the 22% (28/126)
of single units responding to at least one scene, 32% (n = 9)
responded to at least 25% of scenes compared with 4.1%
responding to 25% of a matched number of nonscenes (P < 10−6
).
Thus, PHC responses to stimuli with spatial layout were far more
distributed than responses in other areas (and to other stimuli;
Fig. S10). This category effect was much weaker or not present for
the sparser response behavior of entorhinal and hippocampal
neurons (Fig. 4 C and D). In the hippocampus, 14% (n = 119) of
single and multiunits responded to at least one scene (to nonscenes, 14%; P = 0.31), and of those, 0.84% (n = 1) responded to
at least 25% (to nonscenes, 2.41%; P = 0.96), whereas in EC, 12%
(n = 62) of units responded to at least one scene (to nonscenes,
7%; P < 10−6
), and of those, 4.8% (n = 3) responded to at least
25% (to nonscenes, 0.63%; P = 0.015).
We additionally computed and compared the odds ratio (OR) of
scene to nonscene responses across regions. This ratio measures how
much more likely it is that a unit responds to a stimulus with spatial
layout than to a stimulus without spatial layout. We found that in
both PHC and EC, but not in the hippocampus, the OR was significantly greater than 1, suggesting units were more likely to respond
to scene stimuli than nonscene stimuli (PHC: P < 10−135; EC: P <
10−9
; hippocampus: P = 0.33, exact test of common odds ratio; Fig.
4E). However, the OR was significantly greater in PHC than in the
other two regions (both P < 10−4
), indicating that parahippocampal
units responded to a greater number of scenes relative to nonscenes
compared with units elsewhere in the medial temporal lobe.
These findings show that neurons in PHC respond less selectively within their preferred category (i.e., scenes) than within
other categories, as well as less selectively than neurons in hippocampus and EC, indicating a more distributed code for scenes
in PHC compared with the sparser code in other MTL areas.
Neuronal Scene Responses in the MTL Are Independent of Familiarity.
Some scenes, such as the picture of Mt. Rushmore in Fig. 1, were
previously known to the subjects, whereas others such as the Victorian house were not. To test whether familiarity of scenes had a
differential effect on neural responses in different MTL regions, we
divided all scenes into the categories previously known vs. previously
unknown and compared responsiveness to both categories by computing an OR. We found no significant differences in any of the
three regions examined (PHC: P = 0.24; EC: P = 0.13; hippocampus:
P = 0.95; exact test of common odds ratio). This is in good agreement with a previous study reporting no difference in the proportion
of MTL cells responding to famous vs. unknown landscapes (21).
Discussion
Our results provide insight into how the human PHC encodes space
at the level of individual neurons. The population response was
significantly stronger to images that represent space than to images
that do not, providing further evidence for correspondence between
functional imaging and electrophysiology. PHC neurons prefer
landscapes over persons and animals, but even among persons and
animals, they prefer outdoor over indoor pictures, and even among
these indoor pictures, stimuli with spatial layout are preferred over
those without. Furthermore, PHC neurons were found to respond
faster to landscapes than to other stimulus categories, indicating a
facilitated processing of this stimulus class. In line with results
obtained with fMRI and iEEG (1, 2, 5), comparison of LFP and
unit responses indicated that scene-selective units were spatially
clustered. Furthermore, we observed a distributed code in PHC,
one in which the typical responsive unit was relatively specific to
scenes in general, but not to any one particular scene, whereas, for
example, in the hippocampus, a much sparser code was observed,
one in which the typical responsive unit was not specific to scenes in
general, but was specific to one particular image.
The scene-selective population response observed at the macroscopic level by fMRI could in principle be produced by three
different types of single neuron selectivity profiles. First, units
could exhibit sparse responses, each tuned to relatively few
individual scenes, similar to the semantically invariant neurons
observed in the human medial temporal lobe (13). In this case, the
scene-selective responses observed macroscopically would reflect
the spatial average of neurons with different responses. Second,
each unit could be scene-selective, but respond to many scenes, thus
representing a distributed code, as found in macaque face and scene
patches (14, 15). Third, units might represent conjunctions of lowlevel features more prevalent in scene than in nonscene stimuli,
such that population activity to scenes exceeds that to nonscenes.
The parahippocampal neurons analyzed in this study, similar
to neurons in macaque scene areas (15), but unlike the sparse
neurons elsewhere in the human medial temporal lobe (13),
showed characteristics of a more distributed code (units that
responded to one scene stimulus often responded to many), and
these responses could not be attributed to low-level visual features, as established with the analysis using a feature classifier (the
HMAX model). The second scenario described here therefore
seems most realistic. Of note, a recent study reported a more distributed code for representation of visual stimuli in the human
hippocampus (22). This study, however, used a less conservative
response criterion, thus trading response selectivity for sensitivity, and contained no comparison with PHC representations.
Our study builds on previous intracranial studies of neural activity
in human PHC. Although Ekstrom et al. (23) found no location
selectivity in parahippocampal neurons during virtual navigation, they
found that 15% of parahippocampal single and multiunits responded
to views of shops in the environment vs. <5% in the hippocampus,
amygdala, and frontal lobes. Several studies have reported stronger
broadband gamma activity in human PHC to scenes vs. objects and
earlier selectivity for scenes than for buildings (2, 5), but these studies
recorded neural activity using macroelectrodes instead of microwires,
and thus could not characterize the responses of individual neurons.
Finally, Kraskov et al. (24) previously investigated the selectivity of
spikes and LFPs across several medial temporal lobe regions, including the parahippocampal gyrus. However, they reported no
parahippocampal electrodes with scene-selective LFPs, and few
scene-selective units. Because the number of parahippocampal
electrodes analyzed was small, it is possible that most or all
were outside of the parahippocampal place area.
The response onset latencies of PHC neurons of ∼300 ms are
similar to those reported previously (25) and are substantially
shorter than those found in other MTL regions such as EC,
hippocampus, and amygdala. In addition, this onset of neuronal
firing occurs on average well after the peaking of the evoked LFP
response at 243 ms, and even longer after the onset of selectivity
in the LFP response at 153 ms. This difference in response latency between unit activity and LFP confirms the notion that
neuronal action potentials represent the output activity of a
neuron, whereas the LFP represents postsynaptic input activity
and ongoing neuronal processing (20). These findings are in line
with previous reports that LFP responses precede the onset of
single-cell firing in the human MTL (26).
Our results demonstrate that a substantial proportion of PHC
neurons respond not just to one scene but to multiple different
scenes. This contrasts with neurons in other human MTL subregions, which, in this study and others (27, 25, 28), have been shown
to exhibit much sparser responses. Because previous studies have
shown that neurons in other MTL subregions show a high degree of
invariance to specific concepts, it is natural to ask whether neurons
in PHC, despite responding to a large number of scenes, might
nonetheless encode the locations depicted in an invariant manner.
Because we did not present the same scenes from multiple viewpoints, our data cannot rule out this possibility. However, fMRI
studies have reported that activation in PHC is suppressed by repeated presentation of the same scene, but not when the same location is repeatedly presented from different viewpoints (29, 30).
Assuming that fMRI adaptation measures underlying neural selectivity (ref. 31, but see ref. 32), these results suggest that most
scene-selective PHC neurons do not respond invariantly to the same
scene. Moreover, previous human single-neuron studies have shown
that parahippocampal neurons exhibit little or no location selectivity
1156 | www.pnas.org/cgi/doi/10.1073/pnas.1608159113 Mormann et al.
during virtual navigation (23, 33). Thus, available evidence indicates
that scene representations in the PHC are neither as sparse nor as
invariant as responses elsewhere in the MTL. It is, however, possible that PHC neurons possess some invariance to individual features, if not to individual locations.
Given the well-established role of the MTL in declarative
memory (34) it is plausible to postulate that the PHC responses
described in this study may have a relatively distributed code of
space/location to provide contextual information to more specific
items and associations coded in neurons higher up within the hierarchical structure of the MTL, in the hippocampus and EC. This
notion is further supported by the fact that PHC is one of the
primary inputs to EC and one of few cortical areas that project
directly to the hippocampus (35). This denser distributed code
may be necessary to rapidly form memories and contextual associations in novel environments. Given that scenes are defined by
conjunctions of many features, it is implausible that the brain
could possess sparse representations that are selectively and
invariantly tuned to previously unseen environments. Moreover,
rapidly forming such representations by integrating responses of
neurons that respond sparsely to individual features would require
a very high degree of connectivity. Instead, the brain may form
sparse representations by integrating responses of neurons that
respond to many features, but that are tuned along feature dimensions relevant to distinguishing scenes rather than to low-level
features. In line with this hypothesis, the primary deficit observed
in parahippocampal lesion patients is inability to navigate in novel
environments (3, 4). This denser distributed representation may
similarly be useful in forming novel contextual associations, a
process in which the PHC has been shown to be involved (36–39).
The absence of a region-wide category preference in hippocampus and entorhinal cortex can in principle be attributed to
their sparse and invariant representation (40). However, studies
with a larger number of categories (compared with only landscapes, animals, and persons, as used here) might be necessary to
rule out the presence of category preferences in these areas. In
particular, functional imaging studies have shown that perirhinal
and entorhinal cortex is preferentially activated by objects (41), a
stimulus category underrepresented in this study.
Although our study gives insight into how individual neurons
represent aspects of scenes, its retrospective nature makes it difficult to determine their exact nature. In accordance with neuroimaging studies, we show that single neurons in PHC responded
more strongly to landscapes, outdoor scenes, images with spatial
cues, images with a clearly recognizable background, images with
greater depth, and larger real-world landmarks. However, our
data are insufficient to determine what exactly about these images
and features evokes a response in PHC neurons. fMRI studies
suggest a wealth of parameters these neurons might encode, including scene category (42), spatial expanse (43, 6), texture (44),
and clutter (11). Further studies will be necessary to determine the
specific features to which individual PHC neurons are selective,
and the role of these features in navigation and memory.
Materials and Methods
Subjects and Recordings. Twenty-four subjects undergoing treatment for pharmacologically intractable epilepsy were implanted with chronic depth electrodes
(Fig. S9) to localize the epileptogenic focus for possible clinical resection (45). All
studies conformed to the guidelines of the Medical Institutional Review Board of
the University of California, Los Angeles, and the Institutional Review Board of
California Institute of Technology. Informed written consent was obtained from
each subject. Recordings were obtained from a bundle of nine microwires
(eight high-impedance recording electrodes, one low-impedance reference)
protruding from the end of each depth electrode. The voltage differences
between the recording and reference electrodes were amplified, band-pass
filtered from 1 to 9,000 Hz, and sampled at 28 kHz, using a Neuralynx
Cheetah system. These recordings were stored digitally for further analysis.
During each of 67 recording sessions, 23–190 images (median, 100; interquartile range, 95–124.5) were presented six times in pseudorandom order
on a laptop computer, as described previously (13, 25, 46), while subjects sat
comfortably in bed. Each image was presented for 1 s, at a random interspike
interval (ISI) no less than 1.5 s, and subtended a visual angle of ∼5 degrees. To
maintain attention, after image offset, subjects were ask to press the Y or N
key on the keyboard to signal whether or not the presented image contained
a face. Stimulus sets were composed of persons (grand average 75%), animals
(9%), landscapes (13%), and stimuli from other categories (3%). Around 23%
of the landscape pictures depicted contents the subjects had never seen before, whereas the others contained familiar landmarks and landscapes.
Image Classification. Before analysis, the authors categorized the types of all
stimuli (747 pictures in total) and whether the pictures were indoors or outdoors.
Stimuli were categorized as persons, animals, landscapes (with and without
buildings; i.e., including landmarks), cartoons, food, abstract, or other. The latter
four categories consisted of only a small number of stimuli and were excluded
from further analysis. Indoor/outdoor discrimination was based on the visual
properties of the image, and ambiguous cases were excluded from the analysis of
this attribute. Spatial layout was defined as presence of elements relevant to
navigation, such as topographical continuities in walls, room corners, and horizon
lines. Because this distinction is sometimes ambiguous, one of the authors
(S. Kornblith) and three additional individuals unrelated to this study also classified all
images as possessing or not possessing spatial layout, blind to the neural responses to
these stimuli. Three or more ratings agreed for 94% of stimuli. The remaining
stimuli were excluded from analyses of spatial layout. Data for other classifications
was collected using Amazon Mechanical Turk (SI Materials and Methods).
Population Response Plots. Because composition of the stimulus sets varied
across patients and sessions, we used an automated, objective algorithm (SI
Materials and Methods) to determine a set of 27 stimuli that had all been
presented to the same 743 units to generate Fig. 2 and Figs. S1 and S8.
Spike Detection, Sorting, and Response Magnitude. After data collection, the
signal recorded from the microelectrodes was band-pass filtered between 300
and 3,000 Hz and notch filtered at 2,000 Hz to remove artifacts produced by the
clinical EEG system. The wave_clus software package was used to perform automated spike detection and sorting (47). To assess responsiveness, we calculated
the average firing rate in the periods from 600 to 200 ms before stimulus onset
(the baseline period) and from 200 to 600 ms after stimulus onset (the stimulus
period). To measure the average population response of parahippocampal
neurons, for each unit and stimulus, we computed a z-score-like normalized
response as [mean(stimulus) − mean(baseline)]/standard deviation(baseline). We
then averaged responses across units by stimulus category to yield the response
magnitude values shown in Fig. 3 B and C. For the comparison between different MTL regions in Fig. 3A, we used wider periods from 1,000 to 0 ms before
stimulus onset and from 0 to 1,000 ms after stimulus onset as the baseline and
stimulus period, respectively, as average response latencies in EC and the hippocampus have been shown to be significantly longer than in PHC (25).
Response Onset Latencies. The latencies of PHC units responding to pictures
from different categories were calculated using Poisson spike train analysis,
as described in our earlier work (25). A detailed description of this procedure
is given in the SI Materials and Methods. To compare latencies for two stimulus
categories, we applied two different tests. First, we used an independent-sample
unequal-variance t test to compare the groups of cells responding to each category. If a cell responded to both categories, then the median response latency
for each category was used in each group. Second, we selected all cells that
responded to both categories and ran a paired-sample Wilcoxon signed-rank test
on these cells to compare response latencies.
Local Field Potentials. LFPs were band-pass filtered between 1 and 100 Hz and
notch filtered at 60 Hz (4 Hz bandwidth) before downsampling to 365.5 Hz, using
second-order Butterworth filters in the forward and reverse directions. To
compute the average normalized LFP, we computed the trial-averaged response
of each channel to stimuli with and without spatial layout and divided the result
by the pooled SD of the 1-s interval before stimulus onset, and then averaged the
per condition channel means across all channels. Population LFP selectivity to
spatial layout was tested by averaging the response of each microelectrode across
images with and without spatial layout and performing a paired t test at each of
the 1,096 points in the interval from 1 s before stimulus onset to 2 s after. Selectivity in individual LFPs was determined by a two-sample t test, comparing the
LFP amplitude for stimuli with and without spatial layout at each of the 365
points in the 1-s interval after stimulus onset. In both cases, to be considered
significant, the LFP amplitude had to differ significantly between the two
stimulus groups at a threshold of P < 0.05 after Holm-Bonferroni correction. To
assess the spatial layout selectivity of individual units for comparison with the
selectivity of the LFP and for computation of the spatial clustering statistic below,
for each unit, we performed a Mann–Whitney U test on the firing rates during
the interval from 200 to 600 ms after stimulus onset.

Proportion of Stimuli Eliciting a Response. The proportion of stimuli that
elicited a response (PSER) was computed by dividing the number of stimuli
eliciting a response according to the response criterion described earlier
within a given category by the total number of images within the category.
Because all sessions contained more images without spatial layout than with
spatial layout, naive calculation of the PSER for images with and without
spatial layout would lead to indices with different distributions, thus clouding
interpretation. To make the indices directly comparable, for each cell, we
computed the PSER for images with spatial layout and then randomly drew
an equal number of images without spatial layout with replacement and
computed a PSER for images without spatial layout based on this reduced set.
Proportions of stimuli eliciting a response for matched numbers of nonscene
stimuli and the null distribution, shown in Fig. S10, are based on 1,000,000
applications of this procedure. Because most cells did not respond to most
stimuli, responses are rare events, and standard logistic regression is not
applicable. Instead, we determined the conditional distribution of the
common OR by convolving the corresponding hypergeometric distributions
and found the corresponding confidence intervals by using a root solver
(48). We then computed the mode of the conditional distribution. This
procedure gives an estimate of the common OR, as well as exact CIs.
Analysis of Low-Level Features. We computed the response of the HMAX C1
layer to each stimulus in our stimulus set, using the Cortical Network Stimulator package (49). Features were extracted from the original 160 × 160-
pixel images presented at each subject at nine different scales, using the
parameters described in Mutch and Lowe (50). After extracting the features,
we trained a linear support vector machine on all but one stimulus and tested
the remaining stimulus for each stimulus in our stimulus set. We used LIBLINEAR
to train support vector machines (51), selected the regularization parameter C
using 10-fold cross validation for each SVM trained, and inversely weighted
training exemplars according to proportion in each category.
