Intercellular communication via chemical signaling proceeds with
both spatial and temporal components, but analytical tools, such as
microfabricated electrodes, have been limited to just a few probes per
cell. In this work, we use a nonphotobleaching fluorescent nanosensor array based on single-walled carbon nanotubes (SWCNTs)
rendered selective to dopamine to study its release from PC12
neuroprogenitor cells at a resolution exceeding 20,000 sensors per
cell. This allows the spatial and temporal dynamics of dopamine
release, following K+ stimulation, to be measured at exceedingly high
resolution. We observe localized, unlabeled release sites of dopamine
spanning 100 ms to seconds that correlate with protrusions but not
predominately the positive curvature associated with the tips of cellular protrusions as intuitively expected. The results illustrate how
directionality of chemical signaling is shaped by membrane morphology, and highlight the advantages of nanosensor arrays that can provide high spatial and temporal resolution of chemical signaling.

Chemical signaling between cells is a hallmark of life, with one
key example being neurotransmitter release from neurons to
transmit and process information (1). However, unlike electrical
potential, the measurement of chemical signaling between cells
and within cellular networks is not as well developed, despite its
importance to cellular biology. Neurotransmission via neurotransmitters, paracrine signaling between immune cells, or quorum sensing between bacteria in biofilms (2, 3) rely on spatial
and temporal precision in chemical signaling. Analytical tools are
not yet available to resolve these dynamics. Recently, the groups
of Lindau and Ewing used 4–16 microelectrodes per array per
chromaffin cell to estimate catecholamine release direction and
dynamics (4–6). Nanosensors have several advantages for the
study of cell signaling, as we have highlighted (7, 8). Their
nanoscale size means that they can form dense arrays, increasing
the number of probes per cell. In this work, we construct a
fluorescent nanosensor array placed in the vicinity of PC12
neuroprogenitor cells at a density of ∼20,000 sensors per cell,
with better than 100-ms temporal resolution to study dopamine
release with much higher resolution.
The platform uses near-infrared (nIR) fluorescent single-walled
carbon nanotubes (SWCNTs) rendered chemically selective to
dopamine. nIR fluorescent single SWCNTs are versatile building
blocks for biosensors and demonstrate detection limits down to
single molecules (9–13). We selected the neurotransmitter dopamine for this study because of its central role for reward control
and learning and because it is one of the neurotransmitters for
which volume transmission is heavily discussed (14, 15). The spatially dependent concentration profile of dopamine plays an especially important role when neurotransmitters spill over from
synapses and freely diffuse in all directions (volume transmission)
through neural tissue (14, 16, 17). By placing such dopamine-sensitive nanosensors in arrays beneath dopaminergic cells we are able
to image dopamine efflux, identify hotspots on the cell surface, and
map the directionality of dopamine efflux (Fig. 1A). This platform
has advantages over protein-based fluorescent sensors and semisynthetic protein–fluorophore conjugates on the cell surface in that
it has higher sensitivity, time resolution, and lacks photobleaching
(18–21). Electrochemical techniques, although the most advanced
for measurement of redox-active neurotransmitters in vitro and
in vivo, provide poor spatial resolution (4, 6) to date. Indirect
(optical) methods can label cellular components that are involved
in exocytosis or load vesicles with fluorescent dyes but cannot directly detect the molecules of interest or their dynamics in the
extracellular space (22–24).
Results and Discussion
Previously we found that the corona phase around SWCNTs can be
engineered to recognize certain small analytes––a phenomenon we
termed Corona Phase Molecular Recognition (CoPhMoRe) (7, 25,
26). Specifically, DNA-wrapped SWCNTs were found to increase
their nIR fluorescence in the presence of catecholamines (13). Here,
we synthesized and characterized different DNA/SWCNT complexes and identified the best candidates for dopamine detection (SI
Appendix, Fig. S1). We measured the fluorescence responses of a
panel of 10 DNA-wrapped (6, 5)-chirality enriched SWCNTs versus
a panel of 15 molecules (SI Appendix, Figs. S2–S4) including dopamine, dopamine homologs, and potential interfering compounds
present in biological environments (SI Appendix, Fig. S2). Our results
Significance
Cells communicate between themselves using waves of chemical
concentration that change in both direction and time. Existing
methods are not able to capture this spatial and temporal dependence at the necessary resolution to study the influence of
cellular morphology. This study utilizes arrays of fluorescent
nanosensors based on single-walled carbon nanotubes placed
under and around neuroprogenitor cells to label-free image the
efflux of the neurotransmitter dopamine. We use the spatiotemporal resolution of this approach to resolve where on the cell
surface dopamine is released and how cell morphology affects
the location of release sites.

indicate that (GA)15-ssDNA/SWCNT complexes provide the most
promising selectivity and sensitivity profile for cell experiments
(Fig. 1B and SI Appendix, Figs. S4–S6). These dopamine nanosensors were excited with a laser at 560 nm in a standard fluorescence microscope equipped with an nIR-camera that detects
the nIR emission of (6, 5)-SWCNTs at ∼980 nm. We performed
molecular dynamics (MD) simulations to gain a deeper understanding of molecular recognition of these sensors. Our results
show that dopamine interacts via its two hydroxy groups with
phosphate groups of the DNA backbone (Fig. 1C). This interaction pulls the phosphate group closer to the surface of the
SWCNTs and changes the local potential (SI Appendix, Figs. S21–
S26). These findings rationalize previous phenomenological theories of molecular recognition in the corona phase of SWCNTs
(27, 28). Furthermore, we found that naked SWCNTs do not respond to dopamine at all (SI Appendix, Fig. S8 and S10) and the
least responsive DNA sequences showed the highest (starting)
fluorescence counts (SI Appendix, Figs. S9–S11). This result suggests that movement of the phosphate groups removes (pre)-
quenching sites for excitons and that dopamine’s ability to pull
these groups to the SWCNT surface results in an increase of
SWCNT fluorescence.
With respect to the envisioned application (Fig. 1A) we prepared homogeneously coated nanosensor surfaces and treated
every pixel of the nIR image as a local sensor. Whereas nanosensors are randomly adsorbed on the surface, it would be possible
to pattern them more regularly as it was shown for other nanoparticles (29–31). The SWCNT sensors were densely coated on
the surface to maximize the signal/noise ratio (SI Appendix, Figs.
S12–S14). Ensemble calibration curves (SI Appendix, Fig. S5) indicate that we can detect dopamine concentrations down to 100 nM
(SI Appendix, Fig. S5). However, this is the mean response of a large
population of sensors. When we analyzed individual nanosensors
in the single-molecule regime (100 pM) we observed stochasticity
indicative of binding and unbinding events of single dopamine
molecules (SI Appendix, Fig. S7). To ensure that our sensors were
capable of detecting dopamine in the presence of cells, we cultivated dopamine-releasing pheochromocytoma cells (PC12) on top
of nanosensor arrays that were additionally coated with collagen to
increase cell adhesion (SI Appendix, Figs. S13–S16). Collagen has
been known to increase PC12 cell adhesion and differentiation,
whereas nanotubes affect neurite outgrowth (32–35). Furthermore,
the elasticity of the substrate affects PC12 cell morphology (36).
PC12 cells on our sensor/collagen-coated surfaces attained a morphology similar to PC12 cells cultured without sensors. Similar
scenarios in the literature are nanotube networks that were glycosylated to enhance biocompatibility and have been used for amperometric studies of dopamine release (37). This procedure
increased adhesion and viability of PC12 cells on SWCNT networks. We focused our investigation mostly on isolated PC12 cells
and not clusters to minimize cross-talk from different cells.
Labeling with the fluorescent false neurotransmitter FFN551
showed that PC12 cells on these surfaces contain vesicles with
dopamine transporters, indicating dopamine-containing vesicles
(SI Appendix, Fig. S16) (24, 38). After 1 d of cultivation at 37 °C
in full culture medium, the medium was exchanged to PBS buffer
and the response to dopamine and homologs (10 μM) was tested.
The results (SI Appendix, Fig. S6) show that the nanosensor arrays are still functional and resist biofouling. Catecholamine
homologs such as epinephrine, norepinephrine, and ascorbic
acid could interfere with this array (SI Appendix, Fig. S6).
Therefore, the sensor array reports about the total changes in the
concentration of all catecholamines (ascorbic acid concentrations should be negligible/constant). However, PC12 cells are
thought to mainly release dopamine even though pharmaceuticals and hypoxia can affect the ratio between the different catecholamine neurotransmitters (32, 39, 40). Consequently, sensor
responses are expected to be attributed mainly to dopamine and
to a lesser extent other catecholamines.

DNA sequences to them. They are immobilized onto a glass substrate, and dopamine-releasing PC12 cells are cultivated on top. When cells are stimulated they
release dopamine and the SWCNT fluorescence changes. (B) Fluorescence intensity trace of a single (GA)15-ssDNA/SWCNT imaged on a surface while adding

Those values can be represented in false-color images, and their spatial composition can be further analyzed. (E) Bright-field image of a PC12 cell adhering on top

The results from Fig. 1 indicate that we can use surface-immobilized nanosensors to optically detect dopamine in the presence of
PC12 cells. Consequently, we recorded nIR movies (100 ms per
image, 640 × 512-pixel resolution, 212 nm/pixel) of PC12 cells adhered on collagen-coated nanosensor arrays and stimulated the cells
with potassium buffer to observe dopamine release. To increase the
signal to noise ratio, we divided the field of view into squares of 4 ×
4 pixels and developed a fitting algorithm for the normalized intensity traces of the pixel groups. This algorithm fits the curve
fðtÞ= a+ bt+ ct2 +xe−ððt− yÞ
2
=2z2Þ to the intensity traces (Gaussian
function plus background correction; Fig. 1 D–F).
Consequently we get 20,480 “reporter” pixels per fitted image
(pixel size ∼850 × 850 nm). Therefore, we expect ∼1,700 reporter
pixels under a (round) cell (d = 40 μm), >180 reporter pixels in a
2-μm zone around the cell, and ∼150 reporter pixels under the cell
contour (pixel size = 850 × 850 nm). The fitting process reduced
the 3D movie to a 2D image of fitting parameters, which can then
be further analyzed (Fig. 1D). The different fitting parameters
represent how the local reporter pixel responds to dopamine and
the parameters account for amplitude (x), width (y), and time
point (z) of the event. Fig. 1F shows typical traces from different
locations under the cell, from the cell border, and other regions
[1–5, shown in the bright-field (BF) image of Fig. 1E].
We performed independent analyses to verify that (i) temporal
and (ii) spatial patterns are related to the stimulation time point
and the location of cells. To verify the temporal correlation in raw
data traces (Fig. 2A), we defined three periods (before, during,
and after stimulation) and searched for maxima (in each period)
that would indicate a dopamine-induced fluorescence increase.
The exact stimulation time point (±1 s) was known from the time
point when K+ was added on top of the cells. The nonrandom
distribution during the stimulation period proves that the observed
sensor responses are related to stimulation (Fig. 2 A and B).
Histograms of the normalized sensor signals from different
regions of interest related to the cell (shown in white in Fig. 2C,
Left) prove that the signals are not randomly distributed
throughout the image. Specifically, there is a clear spatial correlation between responses (normalized amplitude change) and
regions associated with the cell (e.g., cell border, cell body). The
time resolution of our approach (100 ms) is not yet fine enough
to observe a propagating wave of dopamine released by the cell
given that the diffusion length scale during image acquisition
x= ffiffiffiffiffiffiffi
2Dt p is ∼12 μm [D = 7.63 × 10−6
cm2
/s (14)], comparable to
the cell diameter. However, the technique is able to localize
release events and their duration as shown below.
Fig. 3A shows the fitted response of the sensors at different
time points from the contour of a single cell (shown in Fig. 3B,
Left). The 3D plots show the sensors turn on after cell stimulation, which indicates release of dopamine. Furthermore, the
responses decay as dopamine unbinds and diffuses away. Fig. 3
B–E shows bright-field images of four different cells and corresponding 3D plots of the sensor response magnitudes along the
cell contour (line width = 850 nm). Here, in contrast to the timeresolved Fig. 3A, the maximum responses of the whole experiment are shown (fit parameter x). The height and color of the 3D
plots indicate the magnitude of sensor responses indicative of
higher transient dopamine concentrations (Fig. 1D). For clarity
we only show responses along this contour (full response plots
are shown in SI Appendix, Fig. S17 and a time-resolved full
hotspot analysis in SI Appendix, Fig. S18).
The contour is also the most interesting region because efflux
parallel to the nanosensor array is centered there with dopamine
concentrations highest at exocytosis sites. The response profiles
show heterogeneity along the contour, which is expected from
multiple dopamine release sites. Furthermore the shape of the
cell affects the distribution of release sites. Fig. 3 demonstrates
the superior spatial resolution of our sensing strategy compared
with existing technology. For example, the groups of Lindau and
Ewing used microelectrode arrays with up to 4–16 electrodes
(per cell) to “image” catecholamine release from chromaffine
cells (4–6). In contrast, our approach contains 349, 242, 192, and
206 sensor pixels just along the contour of the four cells shown in

Fig. 3 B–E and even more (>20,000) in the vicinity of the cell.
Therefore, with nanosensor arrays there are around two orders
of magnitude more sensors positioned on the contour of a single
cell and more than three orders of magnitude more sensors in
the area close to the cell. Compared with amperometric methods, nanosensor arrays currently exhibit reduced temporal resolution but amperometric methods cannot distinguish molecules
of similar redox potential. Therefore, due to the higher chemical
selectivity it is more appropriate to compare nanosensor arrays
with cyclic voltammetry methods, which also have a time resolution of ∼100 ms (20). An advantage of amperometric methods
is their ability to quantify (count) the number of molecules that
encounter the electrode. Fluorescent sensors are more complex
in terms of their signal transduction mechanism but are also
capable of detecting single molecules (SI Appendix, Fig. S7) and
could in principle be calibrated.
In a next step we further analyzed data such as those shown in
Fig. 3 to answer longstanding questions about dopamine efflux
from PC12 cells. If we focus on responses >3× of the mean response (along the cell contour) we can pinpoint to locations that
we refer to as hotspots (>3× mean response) and are distinct
from locations close to the noise level. Fig. 4 A–C shows line
profiles of the sensor response along the cell contour. Hotspots
are maxima in these line plots. They are also shown in the cell
contour in Fig. 4 A–C as blue dashed circles. Arrows in both plots
indicate locations on the cell surface and the line plots show the
responses in a clockwise fashion. It is striking that not all cells
show hotspots, which means that not every stimulation finally
leads to dopamine release. This behavior is known for PC12 cells
and ∼50% of stimulation events do not lead to dopamine release
as measured with electrochemical methods (33).
Our results indicate 2–17 hotspots per cell (contour). This
number is in agreement with electrochemical results from Zerby
and Ewing that indicated ∼28 release events of PC12 cells per
stimulation (41). Hotspots have been discussed in the past but
the lack of spatial resolution of electrode-based methods made it
impossible to directly pinpoint release sites on single cells (42). It
is also known that neurons do not necessarily form well-defined
synapses and therefore it is not known a priori where cells release signaling molecules (43).
Interestingly, hotspots are not accumulated at the tips of
protrusions (see also Fig. 3). The local curvature of the cell
outline was calculated and is color-coded in the cell contour
plots in Fig. 4. Our data (Fig. 4F) indicate that more hotspots are
found in regions of negative curvature (64%) compared with
regions with positive curvature (36%).
However, 65% of the pixels along the cell contours (n = 8)
have a curvature <0. The reason for this ratio is that cells with
protrusions have many slightly concave segments and fewer
strongly convex segments (tips). If the number of hotspots at a
given curvature is normalized to the probability of this curvature
(in all cells), there is no preference for either negative or positive
curvature such as tips of protrusions (SI Appendix, Fig. S20).
However, the nanosensor approach generates single-cell data
about hotspot distribution (Figs. 3 and 4 A–C) and averaging
might bury information.
Previously, it was shown that nondifferentiated PC12 cells release dopamine from the cell body, whereas differentiated PC12
cells release it mainly from structures called varicosities. However,
our data indicate that they are distributed along cell protrusions
with similar probabilities for regions of positive and negative curvature (41). Curvature and membrane tension are known to be a
driving force of exocytosis and therefore spatially resolved images
such as in Fig. 4 could provide new insights into this process (44).
Our analysis focused on the cell border because it is the most
relevant region for studying signaling to other cells. Nevertheless, when all sensors under the cell are analyzed, hotspots under
the cell appear (SI Appendix, Figs. S17 and S18). Total internal
reflection fluorescence microscopy studies of labeled vesicles
demonstrated exocytosis from the bottom of chromaffine cells
(45). However, these methods naturally focus on the parts of the
cell close to the substrate (i.e., cell bottom). Other studies with
different techniques reported exocytosis from the whole cell
surface (46, 47). Our data (Fig. 4 and SI Appendix, Fig. S17) show
that there is release from regions close to the cell border but also
from the cell bottom. It is possible that the functionalization of
the substrate and cell adhesion affect the distribution of release
sites. Furthermore, our sensors directly image the released
molecule whereas these other optical methods image the membrane fusion process.
We further analyzed directionality of release. Fig. 4 A–C
(Right) shows the signals from the cell perimeter region relative
to center of mass of the cell and the arrow lengths indicate signal
amplitudes. These plots reveal anisotropy of release—a measure
not accessible with other methods. Anisotropy of cells translates
into an anisotropy of dopamine release.

The most important cell features that govern anisotropy are
protrusions. Hotspots are associated with protrusions (Fig. 4 D and
E)––not necessarily at the tips but as well in regions where the
protrusions begin (corresponding to negative curvature). To calculate a correlation, angular histograms of all pixels and hotspot pixels
(e.g., Fig. 4D and SI Appendix, Fig. S19) were multiplied and integrated (n = 8). The results were compared with a completely
random distribution of hotspots. Fig. 4E shows that hotspots are
correlated with protrusions and are not randomly distributed. An
anisotropic distribution of hotspots should cause anisotropic dopamine concentration profiles. Cells could therefore shape their signal
by increasing or decreasing the number of protrusions into certain
directions. Obviously primary neurons are anisotropic and the release profile is also predetermined by the geometry and location of
synapses. But, PC12 cells do not form classical synapses and their
morphology resembles tissue cells. Such cells could use this strategy
to adjust and fine-tune their chemical signaling. The distribution of
hotspots around cells is most likely dependent on cell type or may
even change over time for a certain cell. Such differences can be
precisely investigated using our nanosensor array approach.
In summary, we present a method for spatiotemporal chemical
imaging of dopamine release from cells. The spatial resolution of
nanosensor arrays allows us to map hotspots of dopamine release
on cell surfaces and assess anisotropy of dopamine release. We
found that dopamine efflux happens more frequently at protrusions but not preferentially in regions of positive curvature such
as the tips. Furthermore, we show how cell protrusions and anisotropy are correlated with dopamine release and suggest that
this is a possible mechanism for cells to shape a chemical signal.
Materials and Methods
Materials and Preparation of Polymer-Wrapped Carbon Nanotubes. Chemicals
were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich or IDT if not noted otherwise. To wrap
SWCNTs, 2 mg of the 30-mer nucleic acid was dissolved in 1 mL of a 0.1 M NaCl
solution containing 1 mg (6, 5)-enriched SWCNTs (SG65 from SouthWest Nano
Technologies, distributed by Sigma-Aldrich). The solution was tip sonicated for
10 min (3-mm tip diameter, 40% amplitude, Cole Parmer) in an ice bath. Then
samples were centrifuged twice for 90 min at 16,100 g and the supernatant was
collected. All experiments were performed in PBS at pH 7.4. For solution-based
experiments the stock solution was diluted to obtain a final absorption of
0.0075 at the (6, 5)-SWCNT S22-peak maximum at ∼570 nm.
Spectroscopy of SWCNT/Polymer Complexes. nIR-spectra were collected with a
fluorescence spectrometer equipped with a 785-nm photodiode laser (450 mW),
an Acton SP2500 spectrometer (Princeton Instruments), and a 1D-InGaAs OMA V
detector (Princeton Experiments). For all solution-based experiments the SWCNT/
nucleic acid complexes were diluted in PBS to the final concentration and 198 μl of
this solution was placed in a 96-well plate. Then 2 μl of the analyte (10 mM or
less) was added to yield a final concentration of 100 μM or less. All experiments
were done in triplicate and repeated at least twice.
Imaging of Single SWCNTs. SWCNTs were imaged with an inverted microscope
(Zeiss, AxioObserver.Z1) equipped with different objectives [Zeiss α-PlanAPOCHROMAT 100×/1.46 Oil DIC (UV) VIS-IR and Zeiss Plan-Apochromat
63×/1.40 Oil DIC] and an appropriate filter set (Dichroic 620 nm longpass,
900 nm longpass emission filter, Chroma). For image acquisition we used
either a 2D OMA V InGaAs array (Princeton Instruments) with 320 × 256
pixels or a NIRvana 640 camera (Princeton Instruments) with 640 × 512
pixels. SWCNTs were excited with a 561-nm (100 mW–1 W) fiber laser (MPB
VFL series). The laser was expanded by two lenses (Thorlabs) into the back
focal plane of the microscope. The typical laser excitation power was
500 mW.
Cell Experiments. PC12 cells (ATCC CRL-1721.1) were purchased from American Type Culture Collection (ATCC) and cultivated according to the supplier’s
protocol. In short, medium consisting of F-12K medium, 12.5% horse serum,
and 2.5% FBS (all from ATCC) was used. Cells attached to cell culture flasks
(Corning CellBIND) and were passaged when they reached ∼70% confluence. Cells were incubated at 37 °C and 5% CO2.

Fig. 4. Hotspots and directionality of dopamine release. (A–C) Bright-field (BF) images of PC12 cells cultivated and stimulated atop nanosensor arrays.
Responses were analyzed along the contour of the cell (width ∼850 nm) and show hotspots (defined as 3× the mean response). Blue circles indicate hotspots
in the contour picture. Arrows point at specific locations of the cell and corresponding locations in the response profile along the cell contour. Directionality
plots show angular distribution of hotspots. Length of arrows is proportional to the magnitude of the sensor response. (D) Anisotropy of dopamine release is
governed by the distribution of protrusions/cell surface. The histogram shows the angular distribution of contour pixels (cell in A). Hotspots are shown in black
and reveal that they are correlated with protrusions (shown in grey). (E) Hotspots are not randomly distributed but colocalize with protrusions (n = 8). Errors
are SEMs. (F) Hotspot magnitudes (from n = 8 cells) versus local curvature. Hotspots are more often found in regions of negative curvature (64% vs. 36%) but
due to cell morphology there is also more negative curvature per cell (see SI Appendix, Fig. S20 for normalized histograms).

CHEMISTRY NEUROSCIENCE
Sensor surfaces were prepared by the following procedure. First, glass
substrates (#1, ThermoScientific) were functionalized with (3-aminopropyl)triethoxysilane (APTES) in ethanol (1% APTES, 1% water, 1 h).
Then DNA-wrapped SWCNTs [(GA)15 ssDNA if not stated otherwise] were
diluted 1:100 in PBS [corresponding to a final absorption of 0.0075 at the
(6, 5)-SWCNT S22-peak maximum at around 570 nm] and incubated on top of
those surfaces to let them adsorb (1 h). Afterward these surfaces were rinsed
3× with PBS. Then they were incubated with a collagen solution (Collagen,
Type I, C3867, Sigma) overnight at 4 °C and rinsed with PBS. For most experiments the glass substrates were mounted from the beginning in a flow
chamber (ibidi sticky-Slide VI 0.4).
Finally, PC12 cells were sparsely cultivated in full medium on these surfaces
to avoid clustering (at least 4 h). Cell adhesion was verified by light microscopy
and the full medium was exchanged to PBS supplemented with calcium and
magnesium (Sigma). Cells in the flow chamber and all buffers were kept at
37 °C before the experiment. Cell experiments were performed without an
incubation chamber but given the time scale of the experiment (<10 min)
the temperature was close to 37 °C. Cells were stimulated by adding 110 mM
potassium chloride solution to the inlet of the flow chamber (final concentration ∼55 mM for the complete flow chamber volume).
Data Analysis and Fitting Algorithm. Movies collected during cell experiments
were processed by a fitting algorithm to identify regions where sensors
responded to dopamine release. During each frame, the image of 640 × 512
pixels was separated into 4 × 4-pixel groups over which mean intensity values
were calculated, resulting in a time-dependent intensity trace for each of the
20,480 groups. Each intensity trace was fit to the following equation:
I =a +b ·t +c ·t2 +x · eðð−ðt−yÞ
2
Þ=2z2Þ.
The functions formed by parameters a, b, and c represent the possible drift in
baseline intensity caused by defocusing of the microscope during the experiment. The parameters x, y, and z represent the amplitude, peak center,
and SD, respectively, of a Gaussian function used to fit a region of sensor
response. A script was used to process the movies and perform the fittings.
The fitting procedure provided images of fitting parameters.
The curvature of the cell contour was calculated by using a three-point
approximation (48). For each pixel of the contour the mean (curvature) of
the local pixel curvature plus three adjacent pixels was calculated.
