The direct cortico-motoneuronal connection is believed to be
essential for the control of dexterous hand movements, such as
precision grip in primates. It was reported, however, that even
after lesion of the corticospinal tract (CST) at the C4–C5 segment,
precision grip largely recovered within 1–3 mo, suggesting that
the recovery depends on transmission through intercalated neurons rostral to the lesion, such as the propriospinal neurons (PNs)
in the midcervical segments. To obtain direct evidence for the
contribution of PNs to recovery after CST lesion, we applied a
pathway-selective and reversible blocking method using double
viral vectors to the PNs in six monkeys after CST lesions at C4–
C5. In four monkeys that showed nearly full or partial recovery,
transient blockade of PN transmission after recovery caused partial
impairment of precision grip. In the other two monkeys, CST lesions were made under continuous blockade of PN transmission
that outlasted the entire period of postoperative observation (3–
4.5 mo). In these monkeys, precision grip recovery was not
achieved. These results provide evidence for causal contribution
of the PNs to recovery of hand dexterity after CST lesions; PN
transmission is necessary for promoting the initial stage recovery;
however, their contribution is only partial once the recovery
is achieved.

As a potential treatment for brain and spinal cord injury, regeneration of the injured axons has been attempted in animal
models, often using rodents with corticospinal tract (CST) lesions.
Regeneration of the injured CST fibers was facilitated by treatments
such as peripheral nerve graft (1), application of an antibody against
neurite growth inhibitors IN-1 (2), combined application of the
antibody and neurotrophic factor NT-3 (3), and transplantation of
neural stem cells derived from induced pluripotent stem cells (4). A
more recent study showed that regenerated CST axons increased
the connection to the spinal motoneurons (MNs) after spinal cord
injury in monkeys (5). However, in these studies, the causal contribution of such regenerated fibers to the functional recovery was
not directly demonstrated. Therefore, recent debates address the
question whether these therapies should target repairing the
injured CST fibers and/or facilitating compensation by indirect
cortico-motoneuronal (CM) connections via other descending
motor pathways (6–9).
Traditionally, the neural control of dexterous hand movements in higher primates has primarily been associated with
development of the direct pathway from the motor cortex to
MNs, known as the CM pathway (10–12). Lesion of the CST at
the brainstem level in nonhuman primates caused near-permanent
loss of dexterous hand movements (13). The authors also argued for
partial compensation of grasping movements by the brainstemmediated descending pathways such as the rubrospinal tract (14).
More recent studies on the neural basis of functional recovery following CST lesions revealed that a variety of plastic changes in
neural circuits occurred in the supraspinal structures including the
motor and premotor cortices (15), and in the connectivity from the
nucleus accumbens to motor cortex (16, 17). At the more caudal
level, sprouting of the midline-crossing CST fibers was revealed in
the lower cervical segment of monkeys with hemisected spinal cords
(18). In addition, the “indirect” CM pathways via interneurons such
as the propriospinal neurons (PNs), which are located in the midcervical segments and project to hand/arm MNs in the lower cervical segments, and/or reticulospinal neurons (RSNs) in the
pontomedullary reticular formation might also be involved in mediating cortical commands to MNs of forelimb muscles in animal
models with CST lesions (19–21). To demonstrate which pathways
causally contribute to recovery after damage to the CST, selective
and reversible manipulation of particular pathways is needed.
Significance
There are different views about the targets of regenerative
therapies to induce functional recovery in patients with motor
paralysis following brain and spinal cord injury: whether we
should aim at repairing the injured corticospinal tract or at
facilitating compensation by other descending motor pathways. To help answer this question, we used double viral
vectors to reversibly and selectively block the propriospinal
neurons (PNs), one of the major intercalated neurons mediating cortical commands to motoneurons, in monkeys with partial spinal cord injury. We demonstrated causal roles of the PNmediated pathway in promoting recovery of hand dexterity
after the lesion. Thus, targeting the PNs might lead to developing effective treatment to facilitate recovery after spinal
cord injury.

Historically, much less attention has been paid to the “indirect”
CM pathways in the control of dexterous hand movements compared
with the direct CM pathway, because they were supposed not to be
involved in the control of fine digit movements. During the last decade, however, lesion and electrophysiological studies in nonhuman
primates suggested that the pathway through the PNs might be involved in the control of dexterous hand movements in the intact state
(21, 22). However, this suggestion was based on the indirect evidence
obtained by comparing the behavioral effects caused by transection of
the CST at different rostrocaudal levels. Recently, however, a technique was developed that can selectively and reversibly control
transmission via neurons comprising a particular pathway using two
different kinds of viral vectors and doxycycline (Dox)-inducible
tetanus neurotoxin. Applying the technique to the PNs in intact
monkeys revealed that the PN-mediated pathway could carry the
command for dexterous hand movements in the intact state (23).
However, contribution of the PN-mediated pathway to recovery
after lesion of the direct CM pathway in the monkey remains
unclear. In the present study, to examine whether the PNs causally
contribute to recovery of dexterous hand movements after damage
to the CST, we applied the pathway-selective and reversible
blocking method to the PNs in monkeys after lesioning the CST
at C4–C5.
Results
The experiments were conducted on six macaque monkeys (4.0–
6.0 y, 4.0–8.3 kg; see details in Table S1). Two kinds of viral
vectors were injected into the cervical spinal cord of each
monkey (Fig. 1A). The first was a highly efficient retrograde gene
transfer vector, HiRet (24) or its derivatives [FuG-E (25) or
NeuRet (26)], carrying the sequences for tetracycline-inducible,
enhanced GFP (EGFP)-tagged enhanced tetanus neurotoxin
light chain (eTeNT) (27). This vector was injected into the
ventral horn of the C6–Th1 segments, where MNs innervating
distal forelimb muscles are located. The second was the adenoassociated viral (AAV) vector carrying the sequence for the
highly efficient Tet-on, rtTAV16. This vector was injected into
the intermediate zone of the caudal C2 to caudal C4 segment,
where the cell bodies of PNs are located, thus enabling the Doxinducible blockade of PNs (23). CST lesions were then made
between the injection sites of the two viral vectors, mostly in C4–
C5 (Fig. 1 A and B). Two different sets of protocols for administering Dox were arranged (Fig. 1C and Fig. S1) to determine
whether and how the PNs contributed to recovery of dexterous
hand movements after the lesion, as described below. At the end
of the behavioral observation, acute electrophysiological experiments were conducted under anesthesia to confirm the extent of
the lesion and the effects of blockade of PNs by the vectors.
Confirmation of the Extent and Completeness of Lesion. The dorsolateral funiculus was lesioned unilaterally at the C4–C5 segment to completely interrupt the direct CM transmission (15, 17,
19, 21, 28, 29), while sparing the axons of the PNs and RSNs. In
the present study, five of the six monkeys had a lesion in C4–C5
(monkeys U, B, S, K, and R), whereas the lesion of monkey N
was located in C6/C7 (Fig. 1B and Table S1). The extent of the
lesions was 42.5−70.4% of the whole lateral and ventral funiculi
(SI Materials and Methods and Table S1). In monkeys S and N,
the lesions partly extended to the dorsal column. Completeness
of the lesion was examined electrophysiologically by recording the
cord dorsum potentials at C6 and extracellular field potentials in
the deep radial motor nuclei at C6−C7, that is, caudal to the CST
lesion, evoked by stimulation of the contralateral pyramid (Fig.
2G). No direct volleys or monosynaptic negative field potentials
were found in the affected side, which was the side with the viral
vector injections and a chronic spinal cord injury, in any of the
monkeys examined (a representative is shown in Fig. 2H), revealing
that the lesions completely abolished the direct CM connections.
Visualization of “Blocked” PNs. The double-infected PNs were visualized with anti-GFP immunohistochemistry (Fig. 2 A–F and
Fig. S2) (23). Labeled cell bodies were located mainly in the
lateral portions of laminae VI−VII of Rexed (Fig. 2 A–D and
Fig. S2), that is, the intermediate zone where PNs are known to
be located (30). Their longitudinal distribution extended from
C2 to the rostral part of C6 (Fig. 2E and Fig. S2). As described
above, the CST lesion was located mainly in C4–C5. Therefore,
some GFP-labeled cells were located caudal to the lesion in two
monkeys (U and R), presumably due to spread of the vector
solution beyond lesion sites. However, we consider that this

would not affect the main conclusion of this study (Discussion).
Axons and boutons of GFP-labeled cells were found in the motor
nuclei at C6–Th1 (Fig. 2F), suggesting that the blocked cells were
directly connected with MNs innervating distal forelimb muscles.
Confirmation of Blockade of Synaptic Transmission Through PNs. We
examined to what degree the PN-mediated cortical commands to
MNs were blocked by the administration of Dox by recording
extracellular field potentials in many locations of the deep radial
motor nuclei, each separated by more than 200 μm, in response
to stimulation of the contralateral pyramid (Fig. 2G) under anesthesia. To dissociate effects of the PN-mediated pathway from
other indirect pathways that could mediate the cortical commands to MNs, such as those through segmental interneurons
(sINs) and RSNs, the lesions of the dorsolateral funiculus were
made sequentially at the C4–C5 level on the unaffected side and
then at the C2 levels on both sides during the acute experiments
(Fig. 2G). Strychnine was injected i.v. to reduce glycinergic inhibition from the CST. The amplitudes of the disynaptic field
potentials in the affected side were significantly smaller than
those in the unaffected side after acute C4–C5 CST lesion on the
unaffected side (Fig. 2 H and I, and Fig. S3), suggesting that
synaptic transmission through the propriospinal and reticulospinal pathways in the affected side were much weaker
compared with those in the unaffected side. After additional C2
CST lesion on the unaffected side (Fig. 2I and Fig. S3) and on
the affected side (Fig. S3), the amplitudes were very small,
suggesting that contribution of the reticulospinal pathway was
minor in both sides. These findings revealed that synaptic
transmission presumably through the PNs was blocked by 74.2–
93.3% [mean (SD), 83.1 (8.2)] compared with the unaffected
side in four monkeys (U, S, N, and K), whereas no significant
blocking was observed in monkey B, as will be discussed later. No
data were obtained from monkey R due to a sudden change in
the monkey’s condition during the experiment.
Partially Impaired Recovery of Dexterous Hand Movements After the
CST Lesion by Transient Blockade of PNs. We conducted behavioral
observations of recovery time courses after the CST lesions using
a reach and grasp task (Fig. 3 and Movies S1–S4). The monkeys
were trained to reach for and grasp a piece of sweet potato
presented on the other side of a slit (8- to 10-mm width) with a
precision grip, which was defined as a grip using just the index
finger and the pad of thumb (the first and third rows of Fig. 3A,
the Left of Fig. 3B, the first row of Fig. 4A, the Left of Fig. 4B,
and Movies S1 and S3). Before lesion, administration of Dox
partly and transiently impaired these dexterous hand movements, such as precision grip, correctness of gripping, and
reaching, consistent with a previous study (23). During administering Dox, success rate (SI Materials and Methods, Behavioral
Testing) dropped by 15.8–34.1% in transiently PN-blocked
monkeys (U, B, S, and N). One to 2 mo after lesion, administration of Dox impaired dexterous hand movements that had
already shown recovery, for instance, in cooperative movements
of the index finger and thumb (Fig. 3 A and B, and Movies S1–
S4). Decreased success rates generally tended to start 1–2 d after
the start of Dox administration and returned to baseline levels
within 1 wk, even after lesion, suggesting a limited role of PNs in
dexterous hand movements in the intact and once-recovered
state. Recovery time courses differed between the following two
groups. In the well-recovered group, including monkeys U and B,
dexterous hand movements recovered within less than 1 mo after
the lesion. On the other hand, in the partial-recovery group
(monkeys S and N), there was no full recovery during the entire
observation period even through intensive rehabilitative training,
probably because of the lesion in C6/C7 (monkey N, Fig. 1B, and
Table S1) and extended lesions to the dorsal column (monkeys S
and N, Fig. 1B) (31) and/or to the ventral part of the lateral
funiculus (monkey S; the extent of lesion was 70.4%; Fig. 1B and
Table S1). Despite different recovery time courses in these two
groups, success rates for recovered or partially recovered

dexterous hand movements decreased significantly during Dox
administration 1–2 mo after lesion (success rates dropped by 19.1–
24.1% in the four monkeys). These results provided evidence for
partial, but causal contribution of the PNs to recovery of dexterous
hand movements after the CST lesion. In contrast, the effects of
Dox administration 2–3 mo after lesion differed between the two
groups; in the well-recovered group (monkeys U and B), no significant decrease in success rates were observed during administration of Dox 71–87 d after lesion, whereas in the partial-recovery
group (monkeys S and N), success rates were still significantly decreased 82–92 d after lesion. These findings suggest that PNs
contribute to recovery in different ways depending on the stage of
recovery, which might vary depending on the severity of the lesions.
It is worth remembering that electrophysiological analysis indicated
that neurotransmission through the PNs was not obviously blocked
in monkey B (Fig. S3). In this monkey, the behavioral effects of
Dox were relatively weak, likely due to low infection and/or expression rate of the viral vectors, as the number of GFP-labeled
cells was small (Fig. S2). It was also supposed that expression of
eTeNT might have deteriorated during the long survival time after
the viral vector injection (255 d; see table in Fig. S1).
Impairment of Recovery Under Continuous Blockade of PNs. In
monkeys K and R, Dox was administrated continuously to suppress PNs over the entire time course of recovery after the lesion.
These monkeys could not perform the precision grip (Fig. 4C,
squares) but could retrieve a small piece of food without dropping it, which we termed a “retrieval,” in most cases by gripping
it with the dorsum of the thumb or palm (Fig. 4B, Right). Successful retrievals with the alternate grips persisted throughout
the entire period of observation (91–132 d after the lesion) (Fig.
4 A and B, Right, and Fig. 4C, triangles). Thus, in both of these
monkeys, continuous blockade of PNs from 1 to 2 wk before lesion
resulted in minimum recovery of dexterous hand movements 3–4.5
mo after lesion (Fig. 4C), despite the intensive rehabilitative
training required during the early period after the lesion (29).
These findings contrasted obviously with those of previous studies,
in which dexterous hand movements of all monkeys with C4–C5
CST lesions of this size largely recovered within 1–3 mo (15, 17,
21, 28). These findings suggested that the PNs played a key role in
promoting the recovery of dexterous hand movements after the
CST lesion.
Discussion
We showed that recovery of dexterous hand movements in
monkeys after a CST lesion was perturbed following the blockade of synaptic transmission through the PNs in the midcervical
cord segments. The effects of blocking PN transmission depended
on when and how long it was blocked along with the ongoing
stage recovery. Based on the present findings, we conclude that
the PNs exert a stage-dependent contribution to recovery of
hand dexterity in monkeys after CST lesions.
Previous studies in rodents suggested that PNs that bypass the
lesion might mediate spontaneous recovery after spinal cord
injury, which were confirmed by anterograde and retrograde
labeling (32, 33) and by lesioning them with NMDA infusions
(34). NMDA infusions cause hyperexcitability-induced death of
cells that are located in injection sites. Transection of the corticospinal fibers at the rostral level to the PNs impaired recovery
(35). These studies suggested a relationship of PNs to recovery,
but such lesion might affect other group of neurons besides PNs,
and demonstration of causal contribution of PNs was still indirect. Furthermore, because there are considerable differences
in neural structures and body apparatus related to hand movements between rodents and primates (12, 36, 37), studies in
nonhuman primates are critical for translating therapeutic strategies to treat spinal cord injury in humans (38, 39). Therefore,

direct evidence to show the causal contribution of PNs to recovery
in nonhuman primates was needed.
In the present transient blockade experiments, the effect of
PN blockade on the success rate for dexterous hand movements
after CST lesion was similar to that before lesion (Fig. 3C). If the
PNs play a major role in recovery, their blockade should be
expected to result in much severer impairment than in the intact
state; however, the effects were weaker than expected. Two
possible explanations might be considered for such low effectiveness of PN blockade on dexterous hand movements after
lesion. First, it is possible that other descending pathways, such
as the reticulospinal tract (20), the rubrospinal tract (14), and the
remaining CST (18) or regenerated CST (5) contributed to the
recovery. However, it is unlikely that either the reticulospinal or
rubrospinal tracts contributed to recovery of dexterous hand
movements in this experiment because synaptic transmission
presumably through RSNs to the deep radial MNs was relatively
minor (see “after C2 lesion” in Fig. 2I and Fig. S2), and
descending axons of the rubrospinal tract were most likely
transected in this animal model of spinal cord injury (40). Second, it is possible that the proportion of blocked neurons among
the entire PN population was relatively small due to a limited
rate of infection by the vectors.
In contrast, the effect of continuous blockade of PNs on recovery was strong and remarkable (Fig. 4). The extent of CST
lesions in these two monkeys (K and R in Fig. 1B; 61.5% and
54.5%, respectively; Table S1) was not larger than those in previous studies (15, 17, 21, 28), which would lead us to expect near
complete recovery. However, in these two monkeys, alternate grip
strategies, which indicate insufficient recovery (41), persisted
throughout the entire period of observation. Here, in contrast to
the low effectiveness in the transient blockade experiments, recovery of dexterous hand movements was not achieved even 3–4.5
mo after the CST lesion (Fig. 4). Therefore, the context of PN
blockade, its timing and length, appear to be critical for the extent
of recovery. Blocking PN-mediated pathway at the same time of
lesioning the CST made it more difficult to induce recovery than
blocking it serially after lesioning the CST. Such phenomenon has
also been previously explained by a changed function in unlesioned systems after serial spinal cord lesions in cats (42).
Our previous study showed that the training during the early
period after lesion was critical for recovery (29). Early training
might be effective in inducing the plasticity of the motor circuits;
however, blockade of the PN-mediated pathway at this stage
perturbed the effect of training, which might have resulted in
poor recovery. Thus, the PN-mediated pathway was likely to
have a more significant role in recovery of dexterous hand
movements during the early period after lesion. In the present
study, we intended to selectively target the descending branch of
PNs, which can mediate cortical commands to the lower cervical
MNs, using a double-virus infection method. However, it should
be kept in mind that, when PN transmission was blocked by the
Tet-on system, neural transmission through the ascending PN
branches targeting the lateral reticular nucleus, one of the precerebellar nuclei, was also affected due to the bifurcating character of the PNs (23, 30). Therefore, the role of PNs in the
recovery of skilled reach and grasp movements revealed in this
study may also be dependent on their ascending pathways mediating the efference copy of movements (43), which will be a
target of future studies.
As a methodological limitation of this study, we observed
blocked neurons in the C5–C6 segments (Fig. 2E and Fig. S2),
presumably caused by spread of viral vectors. We could not exclude completely the possibility for partial contribution of sINs in
the C5–C6 segments to recovery after CST lesions. However, a
few number of MNs in the C5 segment innervate digit muscles,
which were thought to play a critical role in dexterous hand
movements. Therefore, we did not consider that this affected the
main conclusion of this study, namely, the contribution of PNs in
the midcervical segments, which may partly include those in the
C5 segment that are connected to digit MNs beyond segments,
to recovery.
Recently, the reversible, pathway-selective blocking method
combined with double-viral vectors was used also to investigate
the recovery mechanism for skilled forelimb function in the
stroke model rats (44, 45). Wahl et al. (44) showed that, after
cortical lesions, administration of an antibody against the antineurite extension protein Nogo-A before intensive rehabilitative
training enabled new and functional circuit formation of the CST
fibers from the contralesional hemisphere to the contralesional
half of the spinal cord, resulting in almost full recovery of skilled
forelimb function. On the other hand, Ishida et al. (45) showed
that the pathway from the motor cortex to the red nucleus
contributed to recovery through intensive training after internal
capsule hemorrhage. Thus, this method has great advantages in
determining the role of a specific population of neurons in a
recovery process after brain and spinal cord injury. Identification
of a key neural element involved in the recovery mechanism is
crucial, because it can promote development of novel treatments

spinal cord injury. Selectively enhancing the plasticity of the pathways thus identified as being responsible for recovery will become a
key technology to facilitate recovery in future studies.
Materials and Methods
The animal experimental procedures in this study were conducted in accordance with the principles of the National Institutes of Health and the
Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science, and Technology of Japan. The
protocols were approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee
of the National Institutes of Natural Sciences. We recruited eight monkeys
and then excluded two because the infection rate and/or expression of viral
vectors in one monkey were judged to be obviously insufficient and the
extent of lesion of the other monkey was too large; thus, the results of six
monkeys are presented. The monkeys were first trained for a few weeks in a
reach-and-grasp task described previously (15–17, 21–23) and in Supporting
Information (SI Materials and Methods, Behavioral Testing, and Movie S1).
The retrograde gene transfer vector (HiRet/FuG-E/NeuRet-TRE-EGFP.eTeNT)
was then injected into the ventral horn of the spinal cord at C6–Th1 as
previously described (23). One to 10 d after the injection, the anterograde
vector (AAV-2/DJ-CMV-rtTAV16) was injected into the intermediate zone of
the spinal cord at caudal C2 to caudal C4. Four monkeys (U, B, S, and N)
received a total of four rounds of oral Dox (15 mg·kg−1
·d−1
, each round, 7–25 d)
before and after the CST lesion. Two monkeys (K and R) received continuous administration of Dox from 8–16 d before the CST lesion to 3–4.5 mo
after the lesion. Video recordings of reach and grasp movements before and
after the lesion were analyzed off-line. The CST lesion was made by transecting the dorsolateral funiculus at C4–C5 under anesthesia with isoflurane
(1–2%). After the end of behavioral observations, acute electrophysiological
experiments were conducted on the cervical spinal cord in five of the six
monkeys (data could not be obtained from monkey R due to a sudden
change in the monkey’s condition during the experiment) under anesthesia
(see details in SI Materials and Methods). After transcardial perfusion with
deep anesthesia, the brains and spinal cords were removed. Histological
examinations were conducted with anti-GFP immunohistochemistry. Full
materials and methods are described in SI Materials and Methods.
