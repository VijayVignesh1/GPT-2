Making a decision involves computations across distributed cortical
and subcortical networks. How such distributed processing is
performed remains unclear. We test how the encoding of choice
in a key decision-making node, the posterior parietal cortex (PPC),
depends on the temporal structure of the surrounding population
activity. We recorded spiking and local field potential (LFP) activity
in the PPC while two rhesus macaques performed a decision-making
task. We quantified the mutual information that neurons carried
about an upcoming choice and its dependence on LFP activity. The
spiking of PPC neurons was correlated with LFP phases at three
distinct time scales in the theta, beta, and gamma frequency bands.
Importantly, activity at these time scales encoded upcoming
decisions differently. Choice information contained in neural firing
varied with the phase of beta and gamma activity. For gamma
activity, maximum choice information occurred at the same phase as
the maximum spike count. However, for beta activity, choice
information and spike count were greatest at different phases. In
contrast, theta activity did not modulate the encoding properties of
PPC units directly but was correlated with beta and gamma activity
through cross-frequency coupling. We propose that the relative
timing of local spiking and choice information reveals temporal
reference frames for computations in either local or large-scale
decision networks. Differences between the timing of task information and activity patterns may be a general signature of distributed processing across large-scale networks.

The posterior parietal cortex (PPC) integrates sensory signals
for impending actions. Firing rates of neurons in the PPC
encode movement intention and the temporal evolution of movement choices (1–13) as well as decision variables such as expected
rewards, the subjective desirability during reward-guided decisions
(14–18), and the certainty in perceptual decisions (19). Decisions
are made within a network that extends across many regions of the
brain (20–25), so efficient and flexible mechanisms are required to
enable distributed computations. Dynamic and frequency-specific
correlations in activity between brain areas are ubiquitous and offer
potential physiological mechanisms supporting distributed computations in decision networks (13, 21, 26–34). We hypothesize that
the encoding of decisions in the PPC should depend on the temporal structure present in neuronal activity. Previous studies have
shown that coherently active ensembles of cells in the PPC predict
reaction times (9) and movement choices (13, 21) better than
neurons without coherent dynamics. However, whether and how
the coding of decisions depends on the temporally structured firing
of PPC neurons remains unknown. We examined temporal structure in the encoding of look-reach decisions by PPC neurons.
Results
We analyzed the activity of 149 units [97 units (31 single units
and 66 multiunits) for monkey C and 52 units (14 single units and
38 multiunits) for monkey R] and 186 simultaneously recorded
local field potentials (LFP) (116 LFPs in monkey C and 70 LFPs
in monkey R, one or two LFP electrodes per unit) from nearby
(within ∼2 mm) electrodes. We first established the presence of
firing-rate encoding of choice and the temporal structure of the
neuronal activity in the PPC (11, 32, 35) before testing whether
and how decision coding varies with the temporal structure of
neuronal activity.
PPC Neurons Encode Upcoming Movement Choices. We recorded neuronal activity while monkeys performed reward-guided look-andreach decisions. At the start of each trial, in the baseline epoch, the
monkeys maintained touch and fixation on a central target. Then, in
the choice epoch, they were presented with two alternatives, a circle
and a triangle, and had to choose one with a combined look-andreach movement (Fig. 1A). We presented targets in two locations,
randomly interleaved trial by trial. Both shapes were associated with
changing reward magnitudes that presented a dynamic and challenging reward environment for the animals (Fig. S1). Each monkey
reliably allocated its choices according to the shapes’ relative reward
magnitudes (Fig. 1B). As expected, the firing rate of PPC neurons
robustly encoded the upcoming movement choice. After choice
target onset, units exhibited a strong transient increase in the firing
rate regardless of the upcoming movement choice (Fig. 1C). Firing
rates separated depending on the movement choice. We quantified
the information about upcoming movements in the firing rate by
estimating the mutual information (MI) between the movement
choice and the firing rate (Fig. 1D). A total of 101 units (68%; 68
units for monkey C and 33 units for monkey R) exhibited significant
choice-MI in the choice epoch (200–1,000 ms after choice target
onset) (permutation tests, P < 0.05).
Decision-Related Activity Across Time Scales. We next assessed the
temporal structure of PPC activity by estimating the spike-field
coherence (SFC) and LFP power spectra. Overall 127 units (85%;
Significance
A central question in systems neuroscience is how cognitive
functions can arise from the interplay of many different brain
areas. For example the cognitive act of forming a decision requires a concerted computation involving sensory, mnemonic,
and executive information residing in neural circuits that have
different anatomical locations, that operate on different temporal scales, and that extend over different spatial dimensions.
We find that in a central cortical hub—the posterior parietal
cortex—firing rate information about upcoming decisions is
pulsed according to intrinsic temporal structure in the betaand gamma-frequency ranges. The brain may use temporal
structure at several time scales to support distributed computations that underlie reward-guided decisions.

84 units for monkey C and 43 units for monkey R) showed significant SFC with the nearby LFP during the baseline epoch (the
500 ms preceding the target onset), and 119 units (79%; 78 units for
monkey C and 41 units for monkey R) showed significant SFC
during the choice epoch (200–700 ms after target onset). We found
prominent SFC with a peak in the beta-frequency range (12–30 Hz)
[permutation tests, familywise error probability (PFWER) < 0.05]
(Fig. 2 A and B). Beta activity varied with task epoch. SFC and
power (Fig. 2A, Inset) decreased significantly during the choice
epoch compared with the baseline epoch [permutation tests, falsediscovery rate probability (PFDR) < 0.05] (Fig. 2A). In total 118 units
[33 single units (73%) and 85 multiunits (82%)] were beta coherent
during the baseline epoch, and 95 units [23 single units (51%) and
72 multiunits (85%)] were beta coherent during the choice epoch.
SFC also exhibited a peak in the theta-frequency range (2–8 Hz)
(permutation tests, PFWER < 0.05) (Fig. 2 A and B). Theta SFC and
LFP power did not differ between baseline and choice epochs
(permutation tests, PFDR > 0.05) (Fig. 2A). We found that 102 units
[22 single units (49%) and 80 multiunits (77%)] were theta coherent
during the baseline epoch, and 98 units [20 single units (44%) and
78 multiunits (75%)] were theta coherent during the choice epoch.
Last, the activity in the gamma range (40–60 Hz) varied after the
onset of the choice targets. Gamma-band SFC, but, interestingly, not
LFP power, increased significantly during the choice epoch (permutation tests, PFDR < 0.05) (Fig. 2A). Extending the analysis to
higher frequencies revealed no additional effects (Fig. S2A). Overall 45 units [11 single units (24%) and 34 multiunits (33%)] were
gamma coherent during the touch-and-fixation epoch, and 48 units
[11 single units (24%) and 37 multiunits (36%)] were gamma coherent during the choice epoch.
Given the presence of activity at three distinct time scales, we
wondered whether the activities co-occurred more often than
would be expected by chance during the choice period. We found
that 79 units [17 single units (38%) and 62 multiunits (60%)] were
coherent both in the theta and beta ranges (Fisher’s exact test,
PFWER = 2.27 × 10−8
), 40 units [eight single units (18%), 32 multiunits (31%)] were coherent in the theta and gamma ranges
(Fisher’s exact test, PFWER = 0.0052), and 42 units [10 single units
(22%) and 32 multiunits (31%)] were coherent in the beta and
gamma ranges (Fisher’s exact test, PFWER = 6.53 × 10−5
). Thus, the
units in the PPC often displayed temporal structure across multiple
time scales.
We also examined whether the observed temporal structure
differed between the lateral and medial banks of the intraparietal
sulcus (IPS). We found no significant difference (PFDR > 0.05)
(Fig. S2 C and D). However, the distance between the electrode
tips of the recording pairs influenced the SFC. Electrodes usually
were separated from each other by about 2 mm during the recordings. However, when comparing the SFC for the half of the
recordings with electrode tips near each other (median separation
of 1.07 mm) and the half of the recordings with far electrode tips
farther apart (median separation of 2.86 mm), we found that
higher-frequency SFC (>20 Hz), particularly including the gamma

during the behavioral task. At the beginning of each trial the animals maintained
central touch-and-fixation for 500–800 ms. Two choice targets (a diametrically
opposed circle and triangle) appeared. Either shape could appear on either side
and were informative about average reward magnitudes that remained stable for
50–60 trials before changing to new average magnitudes. After maintaining
central touch-and-fixation for another 1,000–1,500 ms, the central stimuli turned
off, instructing the animals to perform a combined reach-and-saccade movement

activity, was stronger for electrode tips that were closer to each
other (PFDR < 0.05) (Fig. S2 E and F). Thus, gamma activity
appeared to be more local than either theta or beta activity.
Examining the preferred phases of the SFC, we observed clustering around the downswing and trough of the LFP activity (Fig.
2C). We found significant phase concentrations (Rayleigh tests, all
PFWER < 0.05), during the baseline epoch that remained stable
during the choice epoch. Phase concentrations did not differ significantly between epochs for all frequency ranges (Watson–
Williams tests between epochs for all units with significant SFC
during both epochs, all P > 0.05). Thus, PPC spiking contains temporal structure at three time scales—theta, beta, and gamma—that
respond differently to choice. During choice, theta activity remained
constant, beta activity decreased, and gamma activity increased.
Choice Information Covaries with Beta and Gamma Activity. The
temporal structure in PPC spiking suggests that neural encoding
also may depend on the phase of the activity. We therefore
tested whether choice-MI is modulated by LFP phase at each
time scale. We defined eight different LFP phase bins and calculated how much choice-MI varies across the different bins
(Fig. 3A). We analyzed the choice epoch 200–1,000 ms after
choice target onset and included all units that exhibited significant SFC and significant choice-MI during the choice epoch [79
units (53%); 54 units for monkey C and 25 units for monkey R).
The period of 200–1,000 ms covered the choice epoch, avoiding
visual onset transients present in the first 200 ms of PPC activity.
Choice-MI varied significantly with LFP phases in the beta- and
gamma-frequency ranges (permutation tests, PFWER < 0.05) (Fig.
3A) but not with theta phases. Repeating the analysis based on
modulation entropy, which makes fewer distributional assumptions,
yielded similar results (SI Materials and Methods and Fig. S3B). The
information that PPC units carried in their firing rates varied along
phases in beta and gamma frequencies. To understand better how
the beta and gamma phases affected spiking and choice-MI, we next
examined the degree to which each measure depended on LFP
phase.
Beta Activity Modulates Information and Spiking Separately. We
compared the distributions of spike counts and choice-MI
according to beta and gamma activity in greater detail. To do so,
we averaged the phase histograms of spike counts and choice-MI
across the frequency bins with significantly modulated choice-MI
within each frequency range (Fig. 3 B–G). In the beta-frequency
band, the peak-to-trough modulation of spike counts was 13.6%,
corresponding to a modulation in firing rate by about 6.6 spikes/s
(Fig. 3B). Spiking was distributed symmetrically about the spikepreferred beta-phase with no significant differences in the
amount of spiking between the bins before and after the spikepreferred beta-phase (permutation test, P = 0.99). Measuring the
spike counts for evenly spaced beta-activity phase bins allowed us
to study the temporal concentration (trigonometric moment) of
spiking in great detail (see radial black lines in Fig. 3 B–F). The
moment of the beta spike-count histogram was indistinguishable
from the average spike-preferred beta phase during the analysis
epoch, further indicating the symmetry of the distribution of spikes
with beta-frequency phase.
Choice-MI showed a peak-to-trough modulation by the beta
activity of 15.3%. Unlike the spike counts, the choice-MI was
asymmetric around the spike-preferred beta phase. The moment
of the choice-MI histogram differed significantly from the moment
of the beta spike-count histogram (permutation test, P < 10−4
)
with MI peaking during the downswing of the spiking cycle (Fig.
3C). In other words, spike count and choice-MI peaked at different times during the beta activity. In line with this asymmetry,
choice-MI was significantly elevated above the average choice-MI

activity. The green bin at 0 corresponds to the average spike-preferred phase in the 200–1,000 ms epoch after target onset. The radial distance for each phase bin
indicates the difference in spike count to random phases. Error bars depict 95% confidence intervals. The radial black line depicts the trigonometric moment of the

for phase bins during the downswing of the beta activity and was
significantly decreased for phase bins in the upswing of the beta
activity (Fig. 3C, permutation tests, P < 0.05). To assess directly
whether the beta activity varied with the spike counts and encoding
properties of PPC neurons independently, we repeated the analysis
after estimating an orthogonal-MI. To estimate the orthogonal-MI,
we removed the spike-count histogram’s prediction about the shape
of the choice-MI histogram for each unit through regression (Fig.
3D and Fig. S4). The orthogonal-MI histogram was significantly
modulated (permutation test, P < 10−4
). Thus, beta activity independently correlated with the spike counts and choice encoding of
PPC units.
Information and Spike Counts Linked with Gamma Activity. We repeated
the above analyses for gamma activity (Fig. 3 E–G). The peak-totrough modulation of spiking along the gamma phases was 6.2%,
corresponding to a firing rate modulation of approximately three
spikes/s. Similar to beta activity, the spike count was distributed
symmetrically about the spike-preferred gamma phase (Fig. 3E). The
moment of the spike-count histogram aligned with the average spikepreferred gamma phase. Peak-to-trough modulation of choice-MI by
gamma activity was 12.3%. Choice-MI shared the same temporal
concentration along gamma phases (Fig. 3F). We found no difference
between the moments of choice-MI and spike count in the gamma
activity (permutation test, P = 0.59). In line with this finding, the
phase bin at the spike-preferred gamma phase exhibited significantly
higher MI than the average histogram (permutation tests, P < 0.05).
Choice-MI also was greater in the phase bin following the spikepreferred phase. The moment of choice-MI for gamma activity was
significantly different from the moment of choice-MI for beta activity
(permutation test, P = 10−4
).
We then estimated the orthogonal-MI for gamma frequency activity (Fig. 3G). The orthogonal-MI for gamma activity was distributed uniformly across phase bins (permutation test, P = 0.30). No
phase bin exhibited differences from the average orthogonal-MI
across gamma-phase bins (permutation tests, all P > 0.05). Thus,
correlations between gamma activity, choice-MI, and spike counts
were not independent. MI estimation may have been biased by the
differing spike counts at different phases of activity. MI is positively
biased for smaller samples and is spuriously high for phase bins with
few spikes. We reestimated MI while stratifying spike counts to be
equal across phase bins (SI Materials and Methods). The pattern of
modulated choice-MI by beta and gamma activity persisted (Fig. S5).
All results were consistent when the analyses were performed
separately for each animal (Figs. S6 and S7). The pattern remained
when selecting units based solely on beta or gamma coherence, low
or high firing rates, the lateral and medial banks of the IPS, or near
and far electrode pairs (Fig. S8). We found no significant relationship between theta LFP phases and choice-MI when repeating
the analysis in Fig. 3A for units with significant theta-frequency SFC
(Fig. S9A, permutation tests, PFWER > 0.05). Beta and gamma effects remained significant (permutation tests, PFWER < 0.05). The
pulsed choice-MI was specific to the choice period as well as to units
that encoded upcoming choices. It was absent during the baseline
epoch and for coherent units without choice-MI (permutation tests,
PFWER > 0.05) (Fig. S9 B and C). Overall, beta- and gammafrequency activity modulated information about reward-guided
decisions present in the firing rate. Although fluctuations in spike
counts and information temporally coincided for the gamma activity, information peaked later than spiking for beta activity.
Beta Activity Couples Theta and Gamma Activity. The coupling of
PPC spiking to multiple time scales of activity suggested that the
different frequency ranges might show consistent relationships
among each other. To shed light on possible interactions between the different time scales, we quantified the cross-frequency
phase–amplitude coupling (PAC) (36) and N:M phase–phase
locking (NML) (37). We found that beta activity was strongly
coupled to theta and gamma activity.
We analyzed the coupling strength and phase relationships for
PAC and NML for all electrode pairs with significant SFC in the
choice epoch (200–1,000 ms after target onset). We found significant PAC between theta phases and beta amplitudes (permutation test, P < 10−4
) (Fig. 4A). PAC for theta phases and gamma
amplitudes (permutation test, P = 0.031) and beta phases and
gamma amplitudes (permutation test, P < 10−4
) also was significant, albeit weaker (permutation tests, theta–beta vs. theta–gamma,
P = 0.007; theta–beta vs. beta–gamma, P = 0.01; theta–gamma
vs. beta–gamma, P = 0.48). In addition we found significant
phase concentrations for the preferred PAC phases for the
theta–beta and theta–gamma frequency combinations across the
electrode pairs (Rayleigh tests: theta–beta, P < 10−5
; theta–
gamma, P = 0.007) (Fig. 4A). We found no significant concentration of the preferred PAC phase for the beta–gamma coupling
(Rayleigh test, P = 0.22). Thus, the different time scales of PPC
activity were nested with each other, with slower phases predicting
faster amplitudes. The theta–beta PAC displayed the most pronounced interaction.
We further investigated whether the frequency ranges
exhibited a consistent phase relationships among each other. Phases
at different frequencies can be coupled when the frequencies are
integer multiples of each other with several cycles of a faster time
scale consistently occurring at the same times within one cycle of a
slower time scale (37–39). Again we found pronounced cross-frequency interaction involving the beta activity (Fig. 4C). The strongest
phase–phase coupling was between the beta and gamma phases

(permutation test, P < 10−4
) followed by significant but weaker
coupling between theta and beta phases (permutation test, P < 10−4
;
beta–gamma vs. theta–beta, P < 10−4
; beta–gamma vs. theta–gamma,
P < 10−4
; theta–beta vs. theta–gamma, P = 0.038). Theta phases
were not significantly coupled with gamma phases (permutation test,
P = 0.27). The beta–gamma phase coupling had a consistent phase
difference across electrode pairs with beta phases slightly leading
gamma phases (Rayleigh test, P = 0.008) (Fig. 4D). The beta–
gamma phase difference seemed to match roughly the dissociation
of the moment of the choice-MI from spiking for beta activity. Beta–
gamma phase–phase coupling could contribute to the temporal localization of the choice-MI with respect to the beta activity. However, we observed no correlation between the beta–gamma phase
difference and the moment of the beta choice-MI phase histogram
on a single-spike LFP level (circular correlation, same electrode
pairs from Fig. 3; n = 79, r = −0.063, P = 0.55). We found no
consistent phase difference for the theta–beta phase–phase coupling
across electrode pairs (Rayleigh test, P = 0.93). The different time
scales also displayed significant phase relationships, with the most
pronounced coupling between gamma and beta activity.
Overall, we identified three interrelated temporal modes of
neuronal activity in the PPC. Beta activity took a central role and
was most prominently coupled to slower theta activity through
PAC and to faster gamma activity through phase–phase coupling.
Discussion
Our findings demonstrate a potential role for temporal coding in
the PPC during the formation of decisions and add to a growing
body of evidence linking firing rate information to ongoing
population dynamics in cortex (35, 40–48). Theta-, beta-, and
gamma-band LFP phases patterned spiking activity but had different relations to decision information. Gamma activity encoded task information at phases with the greatest spike rate. In
contrast, beta activity encoded task information at phases when
local populations were not the most active. Theta-band activity
appeared as a relatively nonspecific influence on PPC spiking.
We propose that differences in the timing of task information
and activity patterns may be a general signature of distributed
computations across decision networks.
Beta and gamma activity showed a direct relation to the decision process and were modulated by the onset of decisions. The
phases across both frequency regimes were coherent with each
other and provided a meaningful temporal reference for decoding
decision information contained in PPC neurons’ firing rates.
These observations generally agree with recent findings positing
that beta and gamma activity reflect different network-level processes. Specifically, gamma activity may reflect bottom-up–driven
local processing, and beta activity may reflect top-down–driven
processes that link local information to processing on a larger
cortical scale (31, 49–52). The coherent relationship we observe
between the gamma and beta activity suggests that decision signals
in the PPC arise in the interaction between these two types of
influences. An intriguing possibility is that PPC spiking may
multiplex decision signals into beta and gamma channels (53).
Consistent with the view that beta and gamma activity reflect
two different network-level processes, we found that both choice
information and spike counts were temporally aligned with
gamma activity but choice information peaked later than the
spike counts for the beta activity. These observations may reflect
the more local nature of the gamma activity operating on faster,
more immediate scales. In contrast, beta activity may be tuned to
larger network scales, leading to a separation between choice
information and excitability.
Theta activity was present throughout the trial and at comparable
levels before and after choice target onset. Theta phases did exhibit
a weak relationship to the encoding properties of PPC firing rates.
However, theta phases predicted beta and gamma frequency amplitudes during the choice epoch. These observations are in line
with the view that theta-band activity may regulate activity on faster
time scales (54, 55), potentially to subserve functions (e.g., mnemonic functions) in the interaction with subcortical or allocortical
brain structures with prominent theta activity (56–58).
Our observations agree well with previous reports on the impact
of temporal structure on firing rate encoding in the primate cortex.
During visual stimulation in primate primary visual cortex (48), the
gamma activity enhances selectivity, primarily at around peak excitability. However, during working memory demands in primate
prefrontal cortex (47), information about sequentially presented
objects occurs at different times with respect to the beta activity.
The dissociation that we observe between spike counts and
choice information for beta activity raises questions about how
the activity can be generated and how other neuronal populations can decode such activity efficiently. Specific spike times
within temporally structured activity patterns can result from the
interplay between excitatory drive and inhibition (40–42, 59, 60).
Our results thus suggest that beta spiking in the PPC results from
an asymmetric interaction between excitation and inhibition,
producing a relatively less informative upswing and a more informative downswing of activity with similar activity magnitudes.
The transmission of activity between neuronal ensembles may
benefit from the alignment of excitability phases in downstream
neurons with barrages of synchronized upstream activity (30, 31,
61–65). Our findings are consistent with this view and suggest
that beta and gamma activity may differ in the window of integration by downstream ensembles. Although the gamma activity may be most informative when spiking is greatest, the
integration period for the beta activity may extend past the time
of greatest synchronous activity to include a later period of peak
information. In this way, the computations in the PPC may be
functionally linked to the distributed ensembles underlying the
formation of decisions (9, 13). In summary, we propose that the
relative timing of local spiking and choice information reveals a
temporal reference for computations across local and large-scale
decision networks.
Materials and Methods
Please see SI Materials and Methods for a detailed description of the experimental setup and analytic methods. The experimental setup has been
reported previously (13). Two adult male rhesus macaques (Macaca mulatta),
monkey C (7.5 kg) and monkey R (6 kg), participated in this study. All surgical
and animal care procedures were approved by the New York University
Animal Care and Use Committee and were performed in accordance with
the National Institutes of Health guidelines for the care and use of laboratory animals. Neuronal activity was recorded from the medial and lateral
banks of the IPS up to ∼1 cm anterior to the lunate and parietal occipital
sulci and ∼5–10 mm below the cortical surface (13). We targeted a square 16 ×
16 mm recording chamber over the right IPS in monkey C [MRI-guided stereotaxic (Brainsight; Rogue Research)] and over the left IPS in monkey R
(stereotactic coordinates: 7 P, 13 L). Electrodes were spaced at least 1 mm
(median, 2.09 mm) apart. Recordings were referenced to the metal guide
tube on the dura touching the cortical surface above the recording sites.
Spectral estimates were derived using multitaper methods (time/bandwidth
parameters, 500 ms and 5 Hz) (66, 67). Amplitudes for the PAC were estimated at 20 Hz and 45 Hz with time/bandwidth parameters of 250 ms and
10 Hz. We removed the influence of trial-locked evoked potentials through
regression from each trial before further analysis. For phase-dependent estimates we used eight phase bins centered at 0 and every π/4 steps with a
width of π/3. We controlled the PFWER or the PFDR when multiple testing. For
permutation tests the PFWER was controlled using rank-based maximum
resample statistics (68, 69).
