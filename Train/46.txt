KCNQ2/3 (Kv7.2/7.3) channels and voltage-gated sodium channels
(VGSCs) are enriched in the axon initial segment (AIS) where they
bind to ankyrin-G and coregulate membrane potential in central
nervous system neurons. The molecular mechanisms supporting
coordinated regulation of KCNQ and VGSCs and the cellular
mechanisms governing KCNQ trafficking to the AIS are incompletely understood. Here, we show that fibroblast growth factor
14 (FGF14), previously described as a VGSC regulator, also affects
KCNQ function and localization. FGF14 knockdown leads to a
reduction of KCNQ2 in the AIS and a reduction in whole-cell KCNQ
currents. FGF14 positively regulates KCNQ2/3 channels in a
simplified expression system. FGF14 interacts with KCNQ2 at a
site distinct from the FGF14–VGSC interaction surface, thus enabling the bridging of NaV1.6 and KCNQ2. These data implicate
FGF14 as an organizer of channel localization in the AIS and provide insight into the coordination of KCNQ and VGSC conductances in the regulation of membrane potential.
FGF14 | KCNQ2 | fibroblast growth factor homologous factors | axon initial
segment | ankyrin-G
Neurons express a wide diversity of ion channels and yet are
able to target different channels specifically to cellular
subcompartments such as the axon initial segment (AIS) (1, 2).
Among the channels specifically targeted to the AIS are the
voltage-gated sodium channels (VGSCs) and KCNQ2/3 (Kv7.2/
Kv7.3) voltage-gated potassium channels (3–5). VGSCs are
trapped in the AIS through binding to the scaffolding protein
ankyrin-G (ank-G), which anchors transmembrane molecules to
the spectrin–actin cytoskeleton (4, 6, 7). Localization of KCNQ2/3
channels of the KV7 family to the AIS has been proposed to
follow the model of VGSCs, because KCNQ2/3 channels contain
the same ank-G binding motifs that trap VGSCs (8). Moreover,
VGSCs and KCNQ2/3 channels both bind to the ankyrin repeats
in ank-G, albeit at distinct but overlapping interaction sites (9,
10). However, other determinants for AIS localization outside of
the ankyrin-binding motif have been described, thus pointing to
additional modes of regulation (11–13).
The tight colocalization of KV7 channels with VGSCs has
been postulated to confer specific coregulatory properties. In the
soma, dendrites, and AIS, KV7 channels attenuate subthreshold
depolarization by opposing a VGSC persistent current, whereas
in the nodes, KV7 channels stabilize the membrane potential and
protect VGSC channels from inactivation (14). Although ank-G
serves as an AIS anchor for both KV7 channels and VGSCs, simultaneous binding of both channels to one ank-G molecule has
not been demonstrated, and the molecular mechanisms underlying the coordination between Kv7 channels and VGSCs are incompletely understood. We hypothesized that fibroblast growth
factor homologous factors (FHFs), a subfamily (FGF11–14) of fibroblast growth factors that function as intracellular modulators of
VGSCs (15, 16) are candidate contributing factors. FHFs have
been implicated in neurological diseases characterized by altered
excitability, as exemplified by spinocerebellar ataxia 27 (SCA27)
mutations in FGF14 (17, 18). Because FGF14 interacts directly
with VGSCs, FGF14 mutations have been postulated to cause
disease through VGSC dysfunction. Nevertheless, the pathologic
mechanisms may be broader, as FGF14 also regulates presynaptic
voltage-gated Ca2+ channels (19). Whether the disease process
extends beyond dysregulation of VGSCs and voltage-gated Ca2+
channels is not known.
Here, we focused on the neuronally restricted FGF14 because
it is highly localized to the AIS, it binds directly to VGSCs, and
protects them from inactivation (16, 20–24). We therefore reasoned that FGF14 might coordinate KCNQ2/3 channels and
VGSCs in the AIS. We report that FGF14 is critical to the
regulation of KCNQ2 channels in hippocampal neurons. FGF14
knockdown leads to a loss of KCNQ2 in the AIS and decreases
KCNQ2/3 currents. VGSCs are not required for this regulation
because FGF14 also increases KCNQ2/3 current in a heterologous expression system devoid of VGSCs. FGF14 interacts with
KCNQ2 using an interface distinct from the well-defined VGSC
binding site on FHFs. Thus, FGF14 can “bridge” VGSCs and
KCNQ2. These data not only establish FGF14 as a regulator of
KCNQ2 channels, but also show that FGF14 may be a broad
organizer of AIS ion channels.
Results
Because of the restricted localization of FGF14 to the AIS and
our recent data that FGF14 can regulate multiple ion channels,
we first tested whether FGF14 also regulated the AIS-enriched
KCNQ2 channels. We knocked down FGF14 in neurons by
transfection with either a scrambled control shRNA exhibiting
no homology to any expressed sequence in the rodent genome
(Scr), or a previously validated shRNA specifically targeting
rodent FGF14 (14KD) (19, 25) and visualized KCNQ2 in the
AIS by immunocytochemistry. Neurons transfected with shRNA
(Scr or 14KD) were identified by a GFP reporter and the AIS
was identified by immunostaining for ank-G. An observer blinded to the shRNA treatment obtained images and quantified the
abundance of KCNQ2 by measuring the integrated pixel intensity within the ank-G+ AIS. In neurons transfected with Scr,
Significance
KCNQ K+ channels and voltage-gated sodium channels (VGSCs)
are both critical determinants of neuronal excitability and
highly localized to the axon initial segment (AIS). Although
these two classes of ion channels are functionally and spatially
linked, information about their coregulation is lacking. Here we
report that the VGSC regulator fibroblast growth factor 14
(FGF14) is a regulator of KCNQ channels. FGF14 knockdown in
hippocampal neurons leads to loss of KCNQ localization to the
AIS and reduced KCNQ currents. Expressed heterologously,
FGF14 is a positive regulator of KCNQ channels, ruling out an
indirect VGSC-related effect. FGF14 is capable of binding VGSCs
and KCNQ2 simultaneously at distinct interaction interfaces,
providing a molecular basis for how these channel classes are
coregulated in neurons.

the intensity of KCNQ2 immunoreactivity in the AIS was 99 ±
13% (normalized mean ± error propagated SEM) of the signal
in untransfected cells on the same coverslip in the same field of
view (n = 7 cells in same fields of view), demonstrating that
neurons transfected with Scr were indistinguishable from
untransfected cells (Fig. 1 A–D). In marked contrast, KCNQ2
immunoreactivity in 14KD neurons was reduced by 57 ± 12%
(P < 0.001) in the AIS (Fig. 1 E–H and M), whereas KCNQ2
immunoreactivity in the AIS of untransfected neurons on the same
coverslip was not different from Scr neurons. There was also a
modest 29 ± 11% (P = 0.03) decrease in the somatic KCNQ2
signal from 14KD neurons as quantified by integration across
equal-area regions of interest (Fig. 1F; Scr n = 12, 14KD n = 11).
Because these results were obtained with fully permeabilized
neurons, this somatic staining likely reflects KCNQ2 channels in
the endomembrane system en route to the AIS in these developing cells. The reduction of AIS-localized KCNQ2 in 14KD
neurons was not due to disruption of the AIS, because the intensity and pattern of ank-G immunoreactivity was unchanged
(Fig. 1 G and N). Moreover, the reduction in KCNQ2 appeared
to be specific to knockdown of FGF14, because KCNQ2 immunoreactivity was unaffected by knockdown of the homologous
FGF13 (Fig. 1 I–L and M), which is also abundant in hippocampal neurons and concentrated within the AIS (25). Together,
these data suggested that FGF14 regulates the localization
of KCNQ2 protein in hippocampal neurons, especially within
the AIS.
To determine whether FGF14 regulation of KCNQ2 has functional consequences, we analyzed whether FGF14 affected KCNQ2/3
currents in a simplified expression system. When we expressed
KCNQ2/3 in human embryonic kidney (HEK) cells with FGF14,
we observed an approximate doubling of the K+ current amplitude
at test potentials ≥ −20 mV compared with control cells that were
transfected with KCNQ2/3 and empty vector (Fig. 2 A and B). The
voltage dependence of activation was not significantly changed
(Fig. 2C), suggesting that FGF14 did not alter channel properties
(Fig. S1). Rather, using surface biotinylation (Fig. 2D), we determined that the amount of surface KCNQ2 is increased in the
presence of FGF14, suggesting that the observed increase in
currents is likely due to a larger number of KCNQ2 channels at
the cell membrane. Further, that FGF14 affects KCNQ2/3 channels in a heterologous expression system makes it unlikely that
FGF14 requires a neuronal-specific factor to regulate KCNQ2/3
channels in neurons (Fig. 1).
We therefore tested whether FGF14 knockdown in hippocampal neurons reduced the KCNQ current. To isolate the
KCNQ current, we first recorded the basal K+ current amplitude
after blocking voltage-gated Na+, Ca2+, and Kv1 currents with
tetrodotoxin (TTX), Cd2+, and 4-aminopyridine (4-AP) respectively (basal, Fig. 3A). We then applied the KCNQ channel
blocker, XE-991. Subtracting the remaining current (the XE991–resistant component) from the basal current gave a XE991–sensitive current (Fig. 3A, Right). Analyzing the XE-991–
sensitive current showed that the current amplitude obtained
after FGF14 knockdown was markedly reduced compared with
Scr control (Fig. 3 B and C), consistent with the reduced KCNQ2
signal by immunocytochemistry observed in the AIS after FGF14
knockdown. The specificity of the effects of FGF14 are highlighted by comparing the consequences of FGF13 knockdown.
As shown in Fig. 3 B and C, knockdown of FGF13 did not affect
the KCNQ current. This effect was also consistent with the lack
of reduction of KCNQ2 signal in 13KD cells demonstrated by
immunocytochemistry (Fig. 1). Focusing on the XE-991–resistant
component of the current, it was not significantly affected by
Fig. 1. FGF14 knockdown leads to loss of AIS-localized KCNQ2. (A–D) Neurons
transfected with scrambled control shRNA (GFP reporter, white signal) exhibit
localization of (B) KCNQ2 to the AIS as marked by (C) ank-G. Nearby

with FGF14-targeted shRNA (GFP reporter, white signal) lose more than half of

significantly affected across treatments. (*P < 0.05; Scr n = 34, 14KD n = 21,

14KD, although it did trend down in comparison with Scr and 13KD
(Fig. 3C). This may indicate that FGF14 can also affect other K+
channels, although to a lesser degree than for KCNQ channels. In
summary, the electrophysiology data from a heterologous expression
system and from hippocampal neurons implicate direct regulation
of KCNQ2 channels by FGF14, consistent with the reduced
amount of KCNQ2 protein observed by immunocytochemistry in
hippocampal neurons after FGF14 knockdown (Fig. 1).
We therefore queried the consequences of FGF14 knockdown
on integrated neuronal output. Consistent with the observed reduction in KCNQ2/3 K+ currents, and thus a reduction in voltagegated K+ channels open at the resting membrane potential, the
input resistance of 14KD neurons was significantly higher than
of Scr neurons (Fig. 4A). Further, the resting membrane potential of 14KD neurons was also more depolarized than for Scr
neurons (Scr = −55.0 ± 1.1 mV, 14KD = −51.8 ± 0.8 mV, P <
0.05; Scr n = 12, 14KD n = 15). A loss of repolarization was also
suggested by two other observations. First, we observed a larger
amplitude rise in interspike voltage during the course of a 500-ms
current injection for 14KD neurons than for Scr neurons (Fig. 4 B
and C). Second, during action potential trains initiated by current
injection, we noted an increase in the voltages for threshold of
subsequent action potentials in 14KD neurons, even though the
threshold voltage for the first action potential was unchanged (Fig.
4D). Finally, with current injections of increasing amplitude, fewer
action potentials were elicited from 14KD neurons than from Scr
control neurons (Fig. 4E), in agreement with previous work on
FGF14 loss-of-function models (18, 22). Thus, FGF14 knockdown
in neurons results in changes in passive membrane properties as
well as excitability that can be explained by alterations to both
potassium and sodium currents.
We reasoned that FGF14 regulation of KCNQ2/3 might be
mediated by a previously unrecognized FGF14 interaction with
the KCNQ2/3 complex and tested this hypothesis by immunoprecipitating FGF14 from HEK cells transfected with KCNQ2,
FGF14, or both. Immunoprecipitation (IP) of FGF14 coprecipitated KCNQ2 only when FGF14 was cotransfected (Fig. 5A).
In contrast, the two most abundant isoforms of FGF13 did not
exhibit an interaction with KCNQ2 (Fig. 5B), consistent with the
lack of an effect on KCNQ2 localization and function after FGF13
knockdown (Figs. 1 and 3). Thus, the regulation of KCNQ2/3 by
FGF14 is likely due to a previously unrecognized interaction between FGF14 and KCNQ2.
Having established KCNQ2 as an interacting partner of
FGF14, we sought to delineate the FGF14 binding determinants
on KCNQ2. First, we tested for direct interaction between
FGF14 and a KCNQ2 C-terminal domain (CTD) construct
(amino acids 319–658), hypothesizing parallels with VGSCs (26,
27), the best-characterized FHF binding partners. The FHF interaction site in VGSCs is on the intracellular CTD adjacent to a
calmodulin binding site and the KCNQ2 CTD also contains a
calmodulin binding site (28–31). We therefore tested whether an
untagged recombinant FGF14 (amino acids 70–252) copurified
with a coexpressed 6xHis-tagged recombinant KCNQ2 C terminus construct and recombinant calmodulin. Whereas calmodulin copurified with the 6xHis-tagged KCNQ2 C terminus
on a metal affinity column, FGF14 did not (Fig. 6A, Left). We
also tested another CTD construct (amino acids 626–876) with
similar results (Fig. 6A, Right). This construct did not have the
IQ motif for CaM binding and, as expected, did not significantly
copurify CaM. Having eliminated the KCNQ2 CTD as a direct
FGF14 binding determinant, we performed the converse experiment and tested whether FGF14 bound to a KCNQ2 construct
in which the C terminus was deleted (KCNQ2ΔCTD). We
expressed both FGF14 and KCNQ2ΔCTD in HEK cells and
immunoprecipitated FGF14. Indeed, the KCNQ2ΔCTD still
coimmunoprecipitated, indicating that the KCNQ2 CTD is not

currents. (A) Currents from DIV10–11 neurons recorded in the presence of
TTX, Cd2+, and 4-AP were elicited from a holding potential of −90 mV to
steps from −100 mV to 40 mV (n, Scr = 16, 14KD = 21, 13KD = 16). KCNQ
currents were defined as the noninactivating component of outward potassium current sensitive to 20 μm of XE-991. KCNQ currents from neurons
transfected with FGF14-targeted shRNA (14KD) but not FGF13-targeted
shRNA (13KD) neurons were smaller than currents from neurons transfected
with a scrambled control shRNA (Scr). (Scale bar, 1 nA and 200 ms.)

basal current densities before application of XE-991 and current densities of the

100 ms of the 20-mV voltage step were significantly lower for 14KD than for Scr
or 13KD. A smaller component of this current was XE-991 sensitive in 14KD
neurons, indicating a loss of KCNQ currents. XE-991–resistant currents were not
significantly changed although a decremental trend was observed (normalized
mean ± error propagated SEM, *P < 0.05, ANOVA followed by Fisher’s least
significant difference (LSD).

necessary for interaction with FGF14 (Fig. 6B). To further analyze a specific KCNQ2 intracellular domain(s) contributing to a
possible direct interaction, we coexpressed the KCNQ2 N terminus with FGF14. Immunoprecipitation of FGF14, however,
did not coimmunoprecipitate the KCNQ2 N terminus, although
the full-length KCNQ2 was immunoprecipitated (Fig. 6C). Thus,
FGF14 binding requires the smaller intracellular loops, interactions among multiple domains, or a mediator protein.
Because sequence analysis of those KCNQ2 intracellular domains did not reveal any clear homology to the identified FHF
binding site in VGSC CTDs, we hypothesized that the mode of
binding between FGF14 and KCNQ2 differed from how FGF14
and VGSCs interact and, consequently, the binding determinants
on FGF14 would be distinct between KCNQ2 and VGSCs. Our
structural analyses that had identified the VGSC binding surface
on FGF14 (27) had previously shown that direct interaction
between FGF14 and VGSCs could be disrupted when an exposed arginine residue in FGF14 (R117 in FGF14B) was mutated to an alanine (21). We therefore assessed whether
immunoprecipitation of an R117A-mutant FGF14 (FGF14RA)
coprecipitated KCNQ2. As we previously showed, immunoprecipitation of FGF14RA was incapable of coprecipitating NaV1.6.
In stark contrast, however, immunoprecipitation of FGF14RA
coprecipitated KCNQ2 (Fig. 7). This finding indicated separate
interaction surfaces on FGF14 for binding VGSCs and KCNQ2.
Distinct interaction surfaces for VGSCs and KCNQ2 on
FGF14 implied that FGF14 might bind these two ion channels
simultaneously, thereby providing a basis for KCNQ2/3 regulation of VGSC currents (14). To test this hypothesis, we coexpressed KCNQ2 and the VGSC NaV1.6 in the presence or
absence of FGF14 and observed whether NaV1.6 coimmunoprecipitated with KCNQ2. Indeed, NaV1.6 coimmunoprecipitated with KCNQ2 only in the presence of FGF14 (Fig. 8).
Together, these data indicated that FGF14 could bridge these
two axonal ion channels.
Discussion
This report shows that FHFs regulate voltage-gated K+ channels.
Although originally described as VGSC modulators, FHFs have
increased their regulatory portfolios, recently shown to include
voltage-gated Ca2+ channels and now K+ channels. We hypothesize that this FHF-dependent regulation of multiple ion channels is a mechanism for coordinating and integrating various ionic
conductances. For example, regulation of KCNQ2 and VGSCs
Fig. 5. FGF14 but not FGF13 binds to KCNQ2. (A) Coimmunoprecipitation
experiments with heterologous expression of KCNQ2 and FGF14 show that
immunoprecipitating FGF14 leads to the coimmunoprecipitation of KCNQ2.
This result is not true when one of these proteins is omitted. KCNQ2 signal is
decreased in input material (supernatant) only when FGF14 is present and
immunoprecipitated, again indicating binding (representative experiment
from four independent trials). Dark bands below the FGF14 bands are IgG
from the antibodies used for the IP. (B) Immunoprecipitation of FGF13 (splice
variants FGF13S or FGF13VY) leads to no discernible signal for coimmunoprecipitation of KCNQ2. This finding indicates that FGF13 does not bind to
KCNQ2 (representative experiment from three independent trials). Dark
bands below the FGF13 bands are IgG from the antibodies used for the IP.
Fig. 6. FGF14 binding to KCNQ2 does not require the C terminus nor is the
KCNQ2 N terminus sufficient for binding. (A) Copurification experiments
with a 6xHis-tagged KCNQ2 C terminus show that calmodulin (CaM) binds,
whereas FGF14 does not. A different KCNQ2 C terminus construct, without
the CaM binding site, copurifies neither FGF14 nor CaM. (B) Immunoprecipitation of FGF14 is still capable of immunoprecipitating a KCNQ2 construct that lacks a C terminus. Omission of either protein does not yield a
significant signal. (C) Immunoprecipitation of FGF14 does not coimmunoprecipitate HA-tagged KCNQ2 N terminus. Coimmunoprecipitation of the
full-length HA-tagged KCNQ2 is shown as a positive control.

within the AIS—where FGF14, KCNQ2, and VGSCs are
concentrated—along with the observation that FGF14 bridges
KCNQ2 and VGSCs provide context to recent data showing
how KCNQ2/3 channels within the axon coordinate with VGSCs
to control membrane potential (14). In that study, inhibition of
KCNQ currents depolarized resting membrane potential because
of loss of a counterbalance to the persistent inward current
through VGSCs. Here, we observed that FGF14 knockdown
and a resulting reduction in KCNQ2/3 currents were also associated with a slight but significant depolarization in resting
membrane potential. Such an effect could not solely be predicted by previously reported FGF14-mediated reduction in
VGSC currents (25), which would diminish the contribution of
the opposing persistent VGSC current (21), because that result
would lead to hyperpolarization. Thus, the direct effects we
observed upon KCNQ currents after FGF14 knockdown suggest
significant regulation of KCNQ channels.
Adding support to this concept that FGF14 exerts its effects
through concerted regulation of multiple ionic conductances are
comparisons with previous studies of KCNQ inhibition in central
nervous system neurons. The resulting effects after KCNQ inhibition (14, 32) are distinct from what we observed here after
FGF14 knockdown. For example, inhibition of the M current
with bath application of XE-991 produced more spikes with a
given current injection. With FGF14 knockdown, however, we observed a rise in membrane potential and input resistance consistent
with M-current inhibition, but we also observed decreases in spike
frequency with current injection (Fig. 4). Specifically, we hypothesize that these differences result from FGF14 regulation of
VGSCs as well as KCNQ2. Decreased excitability after current
injection was previously reported for FGF14 loss of function (20,
24) and was attributed to a loss of FGF14 regulation of VGSCs.
Here we highlight additional effects of silencing FGF14, namely an
increase in the baseline voltage over an action potential train,
which indicate additional effects on repolarizing currents.
Neurons deficient in FGF14 are less excitable, previously attributed to loss of function of VGSCs. Our results, using acute
FGF14 knockdown that obviates any compensatory changes resultant from an embryonic knockout, offer an additional mechanism in that FGF14 deficiency also leads to a loss of function in
KCNQ2/3 currents. In a previous study in cerebellar Purkinje
neurons, action potential firing was impaired and the voltage dependence of steady-state VGSC inactivation was hyperpolarized
after acute FGF14 knockdown (23). Hyperpolarizing injections
restored repetitive firing, indicating the importance of membrane
potential. As we showed here, FGF14 knockdown leads to the loss
of repolarizing drive due to decreased KCNQ2/3 K+ current
amplitude. Thus, the excitability deficits in 14KD neurons (Fig. 4),
in animal models of Fg14 ablation (24, 33), or in patients with
FGF14 mutations associated with SCA27 (17, 18), likely result
from the multiple effects of loss of FGF14.
Structural and biochemical characterization of the scaffolding
molecule ank-G has shown that the ANK repeat domain contains
several target binding sites (9). In agreement with this finding, Xu and
Cooper reported that the modes of NaV and KCNQ2/3 binding to
ank-G differ from each other (10). Thus, our work contributes to a
broadening picture of the intricate molecular arrangements that define AIS organization. FGF14 knockdown does not affect ank-G (Fig.
1) but ank-G knockdown does abolish AIS localization of FGF14
(25). FGF14, therefore, is likely to function downstream of ank-G in
ensuring proper localization of NaV and KCNQ2/3 at the AIS. The
regulatory roles of FGF14 and ank-G are unlikely to be redundant
because FGF14 knockdown affects these ion channels even with
ank-G present; therefore, it is possible that FGF14 and ank-G are
complementary or reinforcing in their regulation of AIS channels.
Our biochemical analyses provide footprints for the interacting
sites on FGF14 and on KCNQ2. First, the FGF14RA mutant on the
VGSC interaction surface, which coprecipitated with KCNQ2 but
not with NaV1.6, demonstrates that the interaction determinants on
FGF14 for KCNQ2 are different from for VGSCs. Thus, the wellcharacterized VGSC CTD interaction surface on FHFs (22, 27) can
be excluded. The demonstration that FGF14 can bind NaV1.6 and
KCNQ2 simultaneously (Fig. 8) further points to an alternative interaction surface on FGF14. The globular nature of the FGF-like
core domain in FGF14 provides several faces that remain unencumbered by an interaction with a VGSC. Within KCNQ2, we
were able to eliminate about half of the protein—and even more of
the intracellular domains—by demonstrating that a KCNQ2 channel
devoid of its C terminus (KCNQ2ΔCTD) was still able to coprecipitate with FGF14 (Fig. 6B). Remaining candidate interaction sites
within KCNQ2 include the small loops between transmembrane
segments S2–S3 or S4–S5. It is also possible that the binding site for
FGF14 consists of multiple domains or that there is a nonneuronalspecific mediator protein between FGF14 and KCNQ2.
The decreased current amplitude of neuronal KCNQ channels
(Fig. 3) after FGF14 knockdown is likely through a mechanism
by which FGF14 regulates KCNQ2/3 surface expression, as indicated by surface biotinylation experiments (Fig. 2). In addition,
Fig. 7. FGF14 binds to KCNQ2 at an interface distinct from NaV binding.
Immunoprecipitation of wild-type FGF14 coimmunoprecipitates both NaV1.6
and KCNQ2. In contrast, immunoprecipitation of a NaV binding-deficient
FGF14RA mutant does not coimmunoprecipitate NaV1.6, but still retains the
capability to coimmunoprecipitate KCNQ2 (representative experiment from
three independent trials).
Fig. 8. FGF14 bridges NaV1.6 and KCNQ2. Immunoprecipitation of KCNQ2 is
only capable of coimmunoprecipitating NaV1.6 in the presence of FGF14.
Omission of any of these three components leads to no signal (representative experiment from three independent trials).

FGF14 may help localize KCNQ2 in the AIS, as we observed a
significant reduction of KCNQ2 signal in the AIS after FGF14
knockdown (Fig. 1). Surface expression and current amplitude
are not always correlated (34) but we find that FGF14 affects
both parameters similar to what we previously showed for NaV
channels (25). In this context, it would be interesting to explore
whether VGSCs and KCNQ2 are coupled in their trafficking and
localization at particular stages in neuronal development and
whether FGF14 plays a role in such a process. Such a result
would be consistent with recent evidence suggesting coregulation
of members of the KCNQ and VGSC families (35).
Materials and Methods
Primary Hippocampal Culture and Transfection. Primary dissociated hippocampal cultures were prepared as described (37), with minor modifications.
After 5 d in vitro (DIV) culture, the neurons were transiently transfected with
0.2 μg plasmid DNA per coverslip using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen),
according to the manufacturer’s instructions.
Immunocytochemistry and Quantification. Cultured hippocampal cells were
fixed with 2% (vol/vol) paraformaldehyde, blocked, and permeabilized with
5% (vol/vol) fish skin gelatin, 0.1% Triton X-100 in PBS. Antibodies used were
Thermo rabbit anti-KCNQ2 PA1-929 (1:200) and polyclonal goat anti–ank-G
(1:1,000, gift from V. Bennett, Duke University, Durham, NC). Imaging was
performed with a Zeiss LSM 780 confocal microscope using an oil immersion
63× objective. Quantification using NIH ImageJ software was performed
based on the methods of Grubb and Burrone (38). In all image analysis, the
experimenter was blinded to the identity of the confocal channels.
Western Blotting and Immunoprecipitation. Cells were lysed with 150 mM
NaCl, 50 mM Tris, 1% sodium deoxycholate, and 1% Triton X-100. Homogenized proteins were incubated with primary antibodies overnight and
immunoprecipitated with Protein A/G beads. Samples were run on Tris-glycine
SDS/PAGE gels and transferred to PVDF membranes.
Biotinylation. Transfected cells were biotinylated with 1 mg/mL EZ-Link Sulfo
NHS-SS Biotinylation (Pierce) in cold PBS, then pulled down with NeutrAvidin
beads (Pierce).
Electrophysiological Recordings. Whole-cell voltage or current clamp recordings were obtained from cultured hippocampal cells or HEK 293T cells
using an Axopatch 200B amplifier (Axon Instruments), with a 5-kHz bandwidth filter.
Molecular Biology. The shRNA sequences targeting both FGF14 and FGF13
were cloned into the pLVTHM plasmid (Addgene) and have been described
previously (19, 25, 39).
