In humans and many other animals, memory consolidation occurs through multiple temporal phases and usually involves more
than one neuroanatomical brain system. Genetic dissection of Pavlovian olfactory learning in Drosophila melanogaster has
revealed multiple memory phases, but the predominant view holds that all memory phases occur in mushroom body neurons.
Here, we demonstrate an acute requirement for NMDA receptors (NMDARs) outside of the mushroom body during long-term
memory (LTM) consolidation. Targeted dsRNA-mediated silencing of Nmdar1 and Nmdar2 (also known as dNR1 or dNR2,
respectively) in cholinergic R4m-subtype large-field neurons of the ellipsoid body specifically disrupted LTM consolidation, but
not retrieval. Similar silencing of functional NMDARs in the mushroom body disrupted an earlier memory phase, leaving LTM
intact. Our results clearly establish an anatomical site outside of the mushroom body involved with LTM consolidation, thus
revealing both a distributed brain system subserving olfactory memory formation and the existence of a system-level memory
consolidation in Drosophila.
Pavlovian olfactory learning in Drosophila creates an elemental associative memory in a simple, accessible insect brain. This form of
behavioral plasticity requires the normal function of NMDARs1, as is
the case in other invertebrate and vertebrate species2,3. Memory
formation in flies thereafter proceeds through several temporal phases
and involves multiple biochemical cascades, which is again similar to
findings from other animal models4–6. In particular, spaced training
produces stronger, longer-lasting memory than massed training, which
is a common property of memory formation7,8. Contrary to the fact
that memory storage involves multiple anatomical regions in other
animal models9, olfactory memory has been proposed to be stored
predominantly in the mushroom body neurons5,10.
The mushroom body is a prominent neuropillar structure in the
insect central brain. Intrinsic mushroom body cells send neurites
ventrally into the calyx, a region of dendritic arborization that is
innervated by efferents from several different regions, including projection neurons from the antennal lobes11. Mushroom body axons project
rostrally as a densely packed and stalk-like structure called the pedunculus to the anterior face of the brain, where they split and give rise
to the dorsally projecting a and a¢ lobes and the medially projecting b,
b¢ and g lobes12. Output neurons from the mushroom body project to
many parts of the central brain. Another prominent neuropil is the
central complex, which consists of four substructures, the ellipsoid
body, the fan-shaped body, the nodulii and the protocerebral bridge.
The central complex lies in the central brain between the pedunculi of
the mushroom body and is bounded laterally by the two antennoglomerular tracts, dorsally by the pars intercerebralis, ventrally by the
esophagus and the great commissure and frontally by the median
bundle and the b-lobes of the mushroom bodies frontally13. The central
complex forms intricate connections to a variety of brain centers, may
mediate communication between the two hemispheres and is believed
to be a control center for many different behavioral outputs13,14.
The mushroom body does indeed have a central role in Pavlovian
olfactory learning5,6,10. Nevertheless, emerging evidence has hinted at
the involvement of other extrinsic neurons and anatomical sites during
olfactory memory consolidation. The cer gene, encoding a cathepsin
inhibitor, most likely regulates LTM through its expression in glial cells
surrounding the mushroom body15. In addition, several enhancer-trap
transposon insertions with expression patterns exclusively outside of
the mushroom body have been identified in a behavioral screen for
olfactory memory mutants, although the functional relevance of
these enhancer traps remains to be verified16,17. Finally, an ‘asymmetrical structure’ in the central complex seems to correlate with
the presence of LTM, but the functional relevance of this observation
is also unknown18.
We recently have shown that NMDARs function in Drosophila
during olfactory learning and thereafter during LTM consolidation1.
Here, using newly-constructed, dsRNA-mediated, UAS-driven transgenes to silence dNR1 or dNR2, we have disrupted the normal function
of NMDARs in the ellipsoid body or in the mushroom body, and have

silenced synaptic transmission from both structures with UAS-driven
dominant-negative UAS-shits1 (ref. 19). We demonstrate dual dissociable roles for NMDARs in the ellipsoid body during LTM consolidation
and in the mushroom body during the middle-term memory (MTM)
phase of early memory processing. Our results suggest that LTM is
stored in the ellipsoid body, outside of the mushroom body.
RESULTS
LTM is abolished by disrupting NMDARs in the ellipsoid body
Functional NMDARs in Drosophila consist of two subunits, dNR1 and
dNR2, both of which are expressed widely in the adult brain, including
in the mushroom body1 and central complex (Supplementary Figs. 1
and 2 online). To address where functional NMDARs are required
during olfactory memory formation, we used the binary GAL4/UAS
gene-expression system20 to target dsRNA-mediated knockdown of
either the dNR1 or dNR2 subunits to various brain regions. For this
purpose, we generated dsRNA-based transgenes (UAS-dsNR1 and
UAS-dsNR2) to silence gene expression in a sequence-specific manner21. dsRNA triggers RNAi interference, an evolutionarily conserved
process of sequence-specific post-transcriptional gene silencing22,23.
RNAi, however, can lead to the degradation of nontargeted mRNAs,
commonly referred to as off-target effects. Using a recently established
algorithm24 and homology blast, we identified zero legitimate off-target
sequences for UAS-dsNR1 and only one (CG17124) for UAS-dsNR2
(Supplementary Table 1 online). Therefore, dsRNA-mediated effects
from both transgenes appeared to be highly specific for dNR1 and
dNR2, and thus to functional NMDARs.
Consistent with this expectation, the UASdsNR1 transgene disrupted LTM in a quantitatively and qualitatively similar manner
(Supplementary Fig. 3 online), as we previously have shown with a specific dNR1
antisense message1
. We have not yet constructed a second dsRNA transgene for dNR2.
dNR1 and dNR2 function together in Drosophila1, however, so the silencing of dNR2
constitutes a third disruption of NMDAR
function. The fact that the LTM defect from
our UAS-dsNR2 transgene is similar to those
from genetic disruptions of dNR1 (see below)
provides strong in vivo evidence against any
different off-target effects from these transgenes. Taken together, the combined use of
UAS-dsNR1 and UAS-dsNR2 provided us
with a specific dsRNA-mediated silencing of
functional NMDARs.
Western analysis revealed that the dNR2
protein was barely detectable in C155/+;
UAS-dsNR2/+ flies (elav/dsNR2), whereas
the heterozygous C155 (elav/+) and UASdsNR2 (dsNR2/+) control flies produced a
clear, single band that corresponded to the
predicted sizes of the dNR2-2 and dNR2-3
proteins (Fig. 1a and Supplementary Fig. 2).
Silencing of dNR2 with UAS-dsNR2 was
further confirmed in situ with immunohistochemistry. Including our previously published
antibody to dNR2 (monoclonal a-5B10), we
have developed four antibodies to dNR2 that
could be used for immunohistochemistry (see
Supplementary Figs. 1 and 2 for details). All
four antibodies labeled the ellipsoid body, suggesting that dNR2 was
expressed preferentially in the ellipsoid body. Notably, two of these
antibodies (a-820-2 and a-820-1) strongly labeled the ellipsoid body,
suggesting an elevated expression of dNR2 in the ellipsoid body
(Fig. 1b and Supplementary Fig. 2). This elevated expression was
specifically diminished in Feb170/+; UAS-dsNR2/+ flies (Fig. 1c,d; see
below for characterization of Feb170), whereas the expression of dNR2
in the protocerebral bridge (Fig. 1c,d) or in the optical lobes (Fig. 1e,f)
was not affected. This reduction in dNR2 did not affect the gross
morphology of the ellipsoid body, however, suggesting that a knockdown of dNR2 to this degree is not necessary for normal development
of the ellipsoid body (Fig. 1g,h).
Western analysis also indicated that the dNR1 protein was reduced
greatly in UAS-dsNR1/+; hs-GAL4/+ flies (P26/dsNR1) after heat
shock, as compared with the heterozygous hs-GAL4 (P26/+) or
UAS-dsNR1 (dsNR1/+) control flies (Supplementary Fig. 3). This
confirmed our previous report that dNR1 could be acutely disrupted with heat shock using a heat shock–inducible GAL4 driver
(P26)1. Behavioral analyses suggested that LTM was abolished, but
anesthesia-resistant memory (ARM) was normal in UAS-dsNR1/+;
hs-GAL4/+ flies after heat shock–induced knockdown of dNR1 (Supplementary Fig. 3), confirming our previous report using a different
genetic method to knockdown dNR1.
The strong expression of dNR2 in ellipsoid body interested us, as
another closely-related substructure of the central complex, the fanshaped body, appears to subserve a short-term memory trace for visual

learning25 and may be involved with LTM formation after courtship
conditioning26. We identified several GAL4 drivers with preferential
expression in these dNR2-positive ellipsoid body neurons (Fig. 2 and
Supplementary Figs. 4 and 5 online). Three GAL4 drivers, Feb170
(ref. 27), Ruslan (ref. 16) and C42 (ref. 28), were chosen for further
analyses, as their expression patterns overlapped only in these NR2-
positive neurons of the ellipsoid body (Supplementary Fig. 5).
Notably, all three GAL4 drivers showed no expression in the mushroom
body (Supplementary Fig. 5). The ellipsoid body contains ten types of
small-field neurons that connect it to other central complex substructures (for example, the fan-shaped body)13. It also contains at least six
types of large-field (R) neurons that arborize as a ring, mainly in the
anterior part13,28. Genetic mosaic flip-out analyses and immunolabeling indicated that the dNR2-positive neurons are the large-field,
R4m subtype (H.-H. Lin, and A.-S.C., unpublished data). These dNR2-
positive R4m neurons are likely cholinergic, as indicated by ChaGAL80 inhibition of their GAL4 expression (Supplementary Fig. 5).
Because we focused on genetic manipulations of dNR1 in our
previous study1, we first disrupted the functional NMDARs in the
ellipsoid body by knockdown of dNR2, and then confirmed our results
with similar genetic manipulations of dNR1 (which also is expressed in
the ellipsoid body; ref. 1 and Supplementary Fig. 2). Knockdown of
dNR2 using Feb170-GAL4 to drive UAS-dsNR2 specifically reduced the
dNR2 protein expression in the ellipsoid body (Fig. 1b–f), without
affecting the gross morphology of the ellipsoid body (Fig. 1g,h). The
same knockdown also produced a 50% reduction in 1-d memory after
spaced training (Fig. 2d). Similarly, disruption of NMDARs by Feb170-
driven transgenic expression of UAS-dsNR1 specifically disrupted 1-d
memory after spaced training (Fig. 2f). We further confirmed this
disruptive effect on 1-d memory after spaced training with Ruslan and
C42 to drive UAS-dsNR2 in the ellipsoid body (Supplementary Fig. 4).
In contrast, the same genetic manipulations had no effects on 1-d
memory after massed training (right panels, Fig. 2d,f), Feb170-driven
expression of UAS-dsNR2 (Fig. 2e) or UAS-dsNR1 (Fig. 2g) had no
effect on 3-h memory after one session of training and Feb170-driven
expression of UAS-dsNR2 (Supplementary Fig. 6 online) or UASdsNR1 (Supplementary Fig. 6) had no effect on memory immediately
after one session of training. Together with other behavior-genetic
dissections dividing olfactory memory formation into four functionally
distinct memory phases—short-term memory (STM), MTM, ARM
and LTM8,17,29—these observations suggest that genetic disruption of
NMDAR function in the ellipsoid body specifically abolishes LTM,
without affecting other earlier memory phases.
Protein synthesis–dependent LTM is specifically abolished
To rule out the possibility that a developmental defect underlay this
LTM defect, we used the tubulin (tub)-GAL80ts transgene with the
binary GAL4/UAS system30. Groups of flies, raised at 18 1C, were kept
for 3 d at either 18 1C or 29 1C before spaced training. We determined
that incubation for 3 d at 29 1C was sufficient for optimal disinhibition
of a Feb170-driven UAS-mCD8::GFP reporter by tub-GAL80ts (Supplementary Fig. 7 online). We observed that 1-d memory after spaced
training was reduced significantly in transgenic Feb170/+;
UAS-dsNR2/tub-GAL80ts flies when kept at 29 1C for 3 d, whereas
such memory was normal in the same flies when kept at 18 1C (P o
0.05; Fig. 3a), suggesting an acute physiological role for functional
NMDARs in the ellipsoid body during LTM processing.
LTM uniquely depends on protein synthesis. Similar to previous
studies8,29, 1-d memory was reduced by 50% in normal flies kept at
29 1C for 3 d and fed cycloheximide (CXM) overnight before spaced
training (left, Fig. 3b). However, in transgenic Feb170/+; UAS-dsNR2/
tub-GAL80ts flies kept at 29 1C for 3 d, CXM feeding did not further
disrupt 1-d memory after spaced training (right, Fig. 3b). This result
confirms that disruption of NMDARs specifically impairs protein
synthesis–dependent LTM in the ellipsoid body.
Consolidation of LTM requires functional NMDARs
When kept at 29 1C (restrictive) for 4 d, shifted to 18 1C (permissive for
inhibition of GAL4 by GAL80) for 3 d, subjected to spaced training and
tested for 1-d memory at 18 1C, Feb170/+; UAS-dsNR2/tub-GAL80ts
flies showed normal 1-d memory (Fig. 3c). This result suggests that
adult-specific disruption of dNR2 during the 4-d incubation at 29 1C
was restored to a normal functional level when the flies were shifted to
18 1C for 3 d. If flies were subjected to spaced training on day 3 of a 4-d

incubation at 29 1C, however, 4-d memory (again at 18 1C for 3 d) was
severely disrupted in Feb170/+; UAS-dsNR2/tub-GAL80ts flies (Fig. 3d).
The dNR2 expression was restored to a normal functional level at the
time of testing (Fig. 3c), thereby revealing a disruption of consolidation
and storage, rather than of retrieval, of LTM by knockdown of dNR2 in
Feb170/+; UAS-dsNR2/tub-GAL80ts flies.
A ‘reversal’ training protocol was designed to further distinguish a
consolidation and storage defect from a retrieval failure. We subjected flies to a second reversal spaced training session 4 d after the
first spaced training, where the original CS– became the CS+ (nonshocked odor and shocked odor, respectively), and vice versa. Thereafter, 1-d memory was quantified (performance indexes were calculated
relative to the second CS+). In the absence of memory formation after
the first spaced training session, reversal memory would be expected to
be near a performance index of 35. If, on the other hand, memory
formation after the first spaced training was normal, then it would
counteract memory formation after reversal training, thereby producing a lower performance index that would be near zero. When UASdsNR2/tub-GAL80ts and Feb170/+; UAS-dsNR2/tub-GAL80ts flies were
subjected first to spaced training on day 3 of a 4-d incubation at 29 1C
and then to reversal spaced training after 3 d at 18 1C, 1-d reversal
memory was significantly higher in Feb170/+; UAS-dsNR2/tub-GAL80ts
flies than in UAS-dsNR2/tub-GAL80ts controls (Fig. 3e). This result
demonstrates normal memory retrieval and implies weakerthan-normal memory storage from the first spaced training in
Feb170/+; UAS-dsNR2/tub-GAL80ts flies. Therefore, functional
NMDARs contribute specifically to the consolidation and storage,
but not to the retrieval of a protein synthesis–dependent LTM in the
ellipsoid body.
Overexpression of dNR2 in the ellipsoid body enhances LTM
We observed that 1-d memory after one or two sessions of training was
significantly enhanced when dNR2 was overexpressed in
Feb170-targeted brain regions (Fig. 4a,b). This outcome is fully
complementary to our dsRNA-based experiments: gene disruptions
produce loss-of-function effects, whereas overexpression of the normal
gene produces gain-of-function effects. Thus, NMDA receptors in
Drosophila function in a manner that is quite analogous to a previous
study in mice31.
LTM retrieval requires neural activity from the ellipsoid body
A physiological requirement for NMDARs in the ellipsoid body during
LTM consolidation argues that a newly acquired olfactory experience is
initially processed in or upstream of the mushroom body5,6,10, but is
then transferred from the mushroom body to the ellipsoid body for
LTM storage. Such a hypothesis predicts that blocking synaptic output
from the mushroom body, but not from the ellipsoid body, during
memory consolidation (that is, during training and in a time window
after training) would abolish LTM, and that blocking synaptic output
from the ellipsoid body after memory consolidation is complete would
disrupt LTM retrieval. To test these two predictions, we combined the
UAS-shits1 transgene with Feb170 or OK107 GAL4 drivers. OK107 is a
GAL4 driver targeting transgenic expression in all lobes of the
Figure 3 Inducible knockdown of dNR2 specifically blocks consolidation and
storage, but not retrieval, of protein synthesis–dependent LTM. (a) Adultspecific knockdown of dNR2 using the GAL80ts repressor of GAL4-mediated
UAS-dsNR2 expression specifically abolished LTM at the restrictive
temperature. After spaced training, 1-d memory was significantly disrupted in
Feb170/+; UAS-dsNR2/+; tub-GAL80ts/+ (Feb170/dsNR2; GAL80ts) flies
when they were shifted from 18 1C to 29 1C for 3 d (right panel; n ¼ 16
performance indexes per group) before training (SP, red arrow) and tested
(black arrow) at 29 1C, but was normal when they were kept at 18 1C
throughout the experiment (left panel; n ¼ 8 performance indexes per group).
(b) Adult-specific knockdown of dNR2 abolished protein synthesis–dependent
LTM. After spaced training, 1-d memory was reduced by 50% in CXM-fed
wild-type flies (+/+ +CXM; left panel), but was not disrupted further in CXMfed Feb170/+; UAS-dsNR2/+; tub-GAL80ts/+ (Feb170/dsNR2; GAL80ts
+CXM) flies, kept for 3 d at 29 1C before training and testing (n ¼ 8
performance indexes per group). (c) After spaced training, 1-d memory
was normal in Feb170/+; UAS-dsNR2/+; tub-GAL80ts/+ (Feb170/dsNR2;
GAL80ts) flies after 4 d at 29 1C, shifted to 18 1C for 3 d and followed by
training and testing at 18 1C, indicating a recovery of NMDAR function at the
permissive temperature. (d) Four-day memory after spaced training was
significantly impaired in the same flies (Feb170/dsNR2; GAL80ts) when
incubated at 29 1C for 3 d, subjected to spaced training, maintained at
29 1C for 1 d and then shifted back to 18 1C for 3 d before testing, indicating
that knockdown of NMDARs for 1 additional day after training is sufficient to block LTM consolidation and storage. (e) After reversal spaced training, 1-d
memory (RS, blue arrow) was higher in the same flies (Feb170/dsNR2; GAL80ts) than in controls when incubated at 29 1C for 3 d, subjected to spaced training,
maintained at 29 1C for 1 d, shifted to 18 1C for 3 d, subjected to reversal training and tested at 18 1C 1 d later, indicating normal retrieval for the former
(n ¼ 8 performance indexes per group). * P o 0.05.

mushroom body (Supplementary Fig. 5). The UAS-shits1 transgene
has been shown to block neuronal transmission in a temperaturedependent, dominant-negative fashion19.
To test the first prediction, we subjected OK107/+; UAS-shits1/+
flies, Feb170/+; UAS-shits1/+ flies or UAS-shits1/+ controls to spaced
training and then maintained them for the first 6 h thereafter at a
restrictive temperature (29 1C). Compared with the results from
control experiments carried out at 18 1C (Fig. 5a) or with control
flies, 1-d memory after spaced training was abolished in OK107/+;
UAS-shits1/+ flies, but was normal in Feb170/+; UAS-shits1/+ flies
(Fig. 5b). To rule out the possibility that the 9-h blocking may cause
irreversible disruption of synaptic transmission from the mushroom
body, OK107/+; UAS-shits1/+ and UAS-shits1/+ flies were kept at 29 1C
for 9 h and then shifted back to 18 1C for 18 h before being tested for
initial learning after one session of training. Compared to UAS-shits1/+
controls, learning was normal in OK107/+; UAS-shits1/+ flies (68 ± 3.3
versus 61 ± 2.3; P ¼ 0.1). This observation suggests that the abolition of
1-d memory in OK107/+; UAS-shits1/+ flies is specific to memory
consolidation. These results demonstrate that neural activity from the
mushroom body, but not from the ellipsoid body, is required during
memory consolidation.
To test the second prediction, we subjected the same three
genotypes to spaced training at 18 1C, maintained them at 18 1C
for 23 h after training and then shifted them to 29 1C for 1 h before
testing them at 29 1C. Under these conditions, 1-d memory after spaced
training was blocked in both OK107/+; UAS-shits1/+ and Feb170/+;
UAS-shits1/+ flies (Fig. 5c). Under the same conditions, however,
sensorimotor responses to the odors were normal in both OK107/+;
UAS-shits1/+ and Feb170/+; UAS-shits1/+ flies, as compared to
UAS-shits1/+ controls (48 ± 4.1 or 40 ± 5.3 versus 49 ± 5.1, P ¼ 0.34
for 3-octanol; 48 ± 3.3 or 39 ± 4.9 versus 39 ± 5.1, P ¼ 0.28 for
4-methyl-cyclohexanol). This observation suggests that memory
retrieval is specifically disrupted in both OK107/+; UAS-shits1/+ and
Feb170/+; UAS-shits1/+ flies. Therefore, after LTM is consolidated,
neural activity from either the mushroom body or ellipsoid body is
required for retrieval. Together, these observations argue that consolidation and storage of olfactory LTM occurs upstream of synaptic
transmission from the R4m neurons of the ellipsoid body. Considering
that memory may be transferred outside of the mushroom
body (during and within the first 6 h after training) for
LTM consolidation (Fig. 5b) and that NMDARs are specifically
required in the ellipsoid body for such a process (Figs. 2–4), our
results suggest that early memory resides in (or upstream of) the
mushroom body and then is transferred to the ellipsoid body during
the consolidation of LTM.
NMDARs in the mushroom body are not required for LTM
The specific requirement of functional NMDARs in the ellipsoid body
for LTM consolidation and storage prompted us to explore the role of
NMDARs in the mushroom body (Fig. 6), the neuroanatomical
structure known to mediate olfactory associations, STM and probably
LTM5,10. dNR2 or dNR1 in the mushroom body were specifically
diminished when UAS-dsNR2 (Fig. 6a–d) or UAS-dsNR1 (Fig. 6g–j)
were targeted to the mushroom body with OK107, whereas their
expression in the optical lobes were not affected. We observed that
1-d memory after spaced or massed training was normal when dNR2
(Fig. 6e) or dNR1 (Fig. 6k) was knocked down, suggesting that
functional NMDARs in the mushroom body are not required for the
formation of LTM or ARM.
The latter conclusion was further confirmed by assessing 3-h
memory after one session of training, which can be broken down
into an anesthesia-sensitive memory (ASM) and ARM8. Knockdown of
dNR2 (Fig. 6f) or dNR1 (Fig. 6l) via the OK107 mushroom
body GAL4 driver similarly disrupted 3-h memory after one session
of training. In contrast, 3-h memory was normal in these
same transgenic flies when subjected to a 2-min cold shock 2 h after
training, which provides a direct measure of ARM8. Similar effects were
also observed when UAS-dsNR1 was targeted to the mushroom
body with two additional mushroom body GAL4 drivers, C739 and
201Y (Supplementary Figs. 5 and 8 online). Together, these data
indicate that functional NMDARs in the mushroom body contribute to
ASM. Memory retention immediately after one session of training was
normal in transgenic flies expressing UAS-dsNR2 or UAS-dsNR1 via the
OK107 mushroom body GAL4 driver (Supplementary Fig. 6), suggesting that STM is also not affected by knockdown of NMDARs in the
mushroom body. Therefore, MTM, but not STM, is the component
memory phase of ASM that was specifically disrupted.
OK107 is a GAL4 driver labeling almost all of the mushroom body
neurons32. Some of these neurons were probably cholinergic, including
the g lobe neurons that are primarily targeted by 201Y and a subset of
the a/b lobe neurons that are primarily labeled by C739 (Supplementary Fig. 5). The rest, a subset of the a/b lobe neurons, were likely
noncholinergic (Supplementary Fig. 5). Therefore, the cholinergic g
lobe neurons are targeted by both OK107 and 201Y, whereas the
Figure 5 Transference of memory from the
mushroom body to the ellipsoid body during LTM
consolidation. Wild-type (+/+), Feb170 or OK107
males were crossed to UAS-shits1 females, and all
of the progeny were raised at 18 1C to minimize
any potential leaky effect of UAS-shits1 on
development. (a) Flies were kept at a permissive
temperature (18 1C) throughout the entire
experiment. After spaced training (SP), 1-d
memory did not differ among UAS-shits1/+
(+/shits1), UAS-shits1/+; OK107/+ (OK107/shits1)
or Feb170/+; UAS-shits1/+ (Feb170/shits1) flies.
(b) Flies were shifted to a restrictive temperature
(29 1C), subjected to spaced training, maintained at 29 1C for another 6 h, shifted back to 18 1C for 18 h and tested at 18 1C. We observed that 1-d memory
after spaced training was abolished in UAS-shits1/+; OK107/+ flies, but not in Feb170/+; UAS-shits1/+ flies, compared with UAS-shits1/+ controls. (c) Flies
were subjected to spaced training at 18 1C, kept at 18 1C for 23 more h, shifted to 29 1C and then tested 1 h later. UAS-shits1/+; OK107/+ andFeb170/+;
UAS-shits1/+ flies had impaired 1-d memory after spaced training, compared with UAS-shits1/+ controls, indicating that the output of neural activity from both
the mushroom body and ellipsoid body is required during retrieval of LTM. In each of the above experiments, wild-type flies were also tested under the same
conditions and showed consistent, higher scores (performance index ¼ 48 ± 3, 40 ± 2, and 48 ± 5 for experiments a–c) than UAS-shits1/+ flies, as reported
by others39. n ¼ 8 performance indexes per group.

cholinergic a/b lobe neurons are targeted by both OK107 and C739. We
observed that 3-h memory without cold shock in OK107/dsNR2 flies
did not differ from that with cold shock in control flies (Fig. 6f),
suggesting that MTM was completely abolished. In contrast, MTM was
only partially disrupted in 201Y/dsNR1 or in C739/dsNR1 flies (Supplementary Fig. 8). These results argue that MTM depends on
cholinergic transmission and is completely abolished when NMDARs
are silenced in all of these cholinergic a/b and g cells.
DISCUSSION
The predominant view of olfactory memory is that it is processed in the
mushroom body5,10. Our data demonstrate a role for R4m neurons in
the ellipsoid body during LTM consolidation, which now suggests
a much broader and more complex neuronal circuitry subserving olfactory memory consolidation in Drosophila. Because genetic
modulations of NMDARs in the ellipsoid body produce effects that
are specific to LTM, components of this complex neural circuitry
appear to subserve at least one specific temporal phase (LTM) of
memory processing. Consistent and complementary to this notion,
consolidation of LTM remains normal when NMDAR function is
disrupted in the mushroom body (Table 1). Thus, the transference of
memory from one anatomical location to another as consolidation
progresses to LTM appears to occur in Drosophila, as in various
other species6,9,33.

Figure 6 NMDAR function in the mushroom body is required for MTM but not for LTM. (a,b) Immunostaining of dNR2 was specifically reduced in the
mushroom body calyx (dendrites) in OK107/+; UAS-dsNR2/+ flies (dsNR2; OK107, b), as compared with OK107/+ controls (OK107, a). (c,d) dNR2
expression in optical lobes was similar between these flies. Scale bar, 50 mm. (e) dsRNA-mediated knockdown of dNR2 in the mushroom body did not affect
1-d memory after spaced or massed training in OK107/dsNR2 flies, compared to controls (+/+, OK107/+ or dsNR2/+), indicating that NMDAR function in the
mushroom body is not required for LTM. (f) dsRNA-mediated knockdown of dNR2 in the mushroom body disrupted 3-h memory after one session of training
(without cold shock) in OK107/dsNR2 flies, compared with control (+/+, OK107/+ or dsNR2/+) flies. In contrast, 3-h memory after one session
of training did not differ among these genotypes if the flies were subjected to a 2-min cold shock 2 h after training. Together, these data indicate that
knockdown of dNR2 in the mushroom body impairs MTM, but not ARM8 or LTM. (g–j) Similarly, immunostaining of dNR1 was specifically reduced in the
mushroom body calyx in UAS-dsNR1/+; OK107/+ flies (dsNR1; OK107, h), as compared with OK107/+ controls (g), but was not affected in optical lobes
in the same flies (i,j). (k) dsRNA-mediated knockdown of dNR1 via OK107 GAL4–driven expression of the same UAS-dsNR1 transgene did not affect 1-d
memory after spaced or massed training, similar to knockdown of dNR2. (l) dsRNA-mediated knockdown of dNR1 via OK107 GAL4–driven expression of the

specifically abolishes protein synthesis–dependent LTM (Figs. 2 and 3
and Table 1), suggesting that the ellipsoid body is important during
memory consolidation. NMDAR function is physiological rather than
developmental, as induction of dsRNA transgenes in adults was sufficient to abolish LTM (Fig. 3). This role for NMDARs is also specific for
memory phase (LTM) and brain region (ellipsoid body). Initial learning
and early memories were not affected when NMDARs were knocked
down in the ellipsoid body, and LTM was not affected when NMDARs
were knocked down in the mushroom body (Table 1). These results,
together with recent observations that LTM formation may require
neuronal activity from the vertical lobes of the mushroom body and
correlates with the appearance of a Fas II–immunoreactive asymmetrical body near the central complex18,34,35, support a broader neuroanatomical circuitry involving both the mushroom body and ellipsoid
body that subserves olfactory memory consolidation.
We also postulate that NMDARs in the ellipsoid body are involved
with LTM consolidation and storage, but not retrieval. Disruption of
NMDAR function during training, but not during testing, severely
diminished LTM, excluding the possibility that memory retrieval was
affected (Fig. 3c,d). Reversal memory was stronger when NMDARs
were disrupted during an initial spaced training session compared with
disruption during reversal training, directly demonstrating these flies’
ability to retrieve memory (Fig. 3e). That retrieval is normal and that
consolidation and storage have failed is consistent with our initial
study1 and with various studies of mammals36.
Blocking synaptic output from the mushroom body, but not from
the ellipsoid body, during training and in the first 6 h after training
abolished consolidation of LTM (Fig. 5b), suggesting that consolidation of LTM occurs downstream of the mushroom body (or possibly in
the mushroom body if the efferents from the ellipsoid body were to
project back to the mushroom body). In contrast, blocking synaptic
output from the ellipsoid body or mushroom body disrupted retrieval,
but not acquisition and consolidation (Fig. 5c). This result is functionally analogous to STM, which is formed in or upstream of the
mushroom body, probably without the involvement of extrinsic
neurons or structures30,32,37, and synaptic output from the mushroom
body is required specifically for its retrieval, but not its acquisition38,39.
Taken together, our observations support a model where memory is first
acquired in the mushroom body and is then transferred to the ellipsoid
body for storage during memory consolidation, in agreement with
various observations from other species where memory transfer from
one brain region to another may occurr6,33,36. Combined with other
recent studies, we would propose (i) that acquisition involves an initial
association of an odor and shock in and/or upstream of the mushroom
body5,10, (ii) that STM resides in the mushroom body30,32,37, (iii) that
MTM is acquired in mushroom body a/b neurons and persists there via
recurrent activity involving the mushroom body a¢/b¢ DPM (dorsalpaired medial) neurons and the mushroom body a/b neurons themselves40, (iv) that LTM consolidation involves the transference of
memory to the ellipsoid body and (v) that LTM retrieval requires neural
activity output from the ellipsoid body and from mushroom body
neurons34. Therefore, our results support a broader neuroanatomical
circuitry involving both the mushroom body and ellipsoid body that
subserves memory processing and retrieval.
Consolidation is the progressive stabilization of memory from a
short, labile form to a long-lasting, stable form. Memory consolidation
commonly refers to two types of processes, early and late consolidation.
Early (or cellular or local) consolidation is accomplished within the first
few minutes to hours after learning and occurs in all of the species
studied to date41. This relatively fast type of consolidation takes place in
local nodes in the neuronal circuit(s) and depends on cross talk among
synapses, somata and nuclei41,42. Late consolidation, which so far has
only been demonstrated in humans and mammals, takes much longer
and involves multiple brain systems36,41–43. Late consolidation is
initiated in parallel to, or as a consequence of, early consolidation,
and is characterized by much slower temporal kinetics. Recent molecular and cellular studies in rodents have shown that a memory initially
depends on the hippocampus, but eventually becomes independent of
hippocampal function and may be consolidated into neocortical
circuits36,41–43. To our knowledge, the existence of multiple memory
systems has not clearly been demonstrated in any invertebrate model
system. Our demonstration that NMDARs are specifically required in
the ellipsoid body rather than in the mushroom body during LTM
consolidation shows that memory consolidation is a systems-level
phenomenon in Drosophila.
It has recently been shown that LTM requires branch-specific neural
activity and CREB in a/b mushroom body neurons35. Notably, the only
GAL4 driver used in that study, C739, is not specific to the mushroom
body; it also labels some ellipsoid body neurons that appear to be
different from the NMDAR-positive R4m neurons (Supplementary
Figs. 5 and 9 online). Consistent with this observation, C739-targeted
knockdown of functional NMDARs left LTM intact (Supplementary
Fig. 8). When neural activity was silenced in UAS-shits1/+; C739/+ flies,
however, memory retrieval was disrupted34. Considering that the cyclic
AMP–dependent neuronal activity in the mushroom body is required
for retrieval of LTM (S.X., H.W. and T.T., unpublished data), these
results raise the interesting possibility that neural activity in the
mushroom body a lobes may be correlated with memory retrieval
rather than memory consolidation.
An intriguing difference exists in systems-level memory processing
between Drosophila and rodents. Though LTM may eventually recruit
the ellipsoid body, the mushroom body appears to be crucial for both
memory consolidation and retrieval in Drosophila. In contrast, the
hippocampus is required for consolidation, but not for retrieval, of
long-lasting memories transferred to cortical systems36,41–43. This
difference may highlight an unusual aspect of olfactory memory in
Drosophila. We recently have found that the encoding of odor identity
and odor intensity is experience-dependent and mushroom body–
dependent44. Thus, the mushroom body appears to be central to
olfactory discrimination as a perceptual task, providing a possible
explanation as to why the mushroom body has to be involved with
retrieval of LTM.
NMDARs in the mushroom body and MTM formation
The mushroom body is clearly involved in olfactory learning, memory
consolidation and retrieval5,6,10. Nevertheless, consolidation of LTM
occurred normally even when the function of NMDARs in the mushroom body was disrupted (Table 1). MTM depends on NMDAR
function in the mushroom body (Fig. 6) and on amnesiac (amn)-
encoded neuropeptides45 expressed in DPM neurons17. DPM neurons
are extrinsic to the mushroom body, but nevertheless send extensive
arborizations to all the mushroom body lobes17. Synaptic output from
DPM neurons is required for the persistence of MTM, but does not
appear to be involved in its acquisition and retrieval46. Consistently,
MTM is proposed to be formed in the mushroom body a/b neurons,
and blocking mushroom body output diminishes the retrieval of
MTM34,40. Taken together, these observations suggest that the involvement of the mushroom body in LTM consolidation may be through an
NMDAR-independent pathway, and that the mushroom body and
ellipsoid body may participate independently in distinct temporal
stages of memory consolidation, a neurobehavioral phenomena that
has been reported in other species9,47.

Understanding how the NMDAR-containing protein complexes are
independently involved, at the cellular level, with different memory
phases in distinct brain regions, and how these distinct anatomical sites
communicate with each other to yield adaptive behavior from prior
experience will be of particular importance in the future.
METHODS
Fly stocks. Flies used were wild-type Canton-S w1118 (iso1CJ), the ‘Cantonized’
UAS-dsNR1, UAS-dsNR2, UAS-shits1, tub-GAL80ts, Feb170, Ruslan, C42,
OK107, 201Y, C739, C155 (elav-GAL4), hs-GAL4 (P26) and UAS-mCD8::GFP.
Feb170 and C42 were from G. Korge (Freie Universitaet Berlin), hs-GAL4 from
Y. Zhong (Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory), UAS-mCD8::GFP from L. Luo
(Stanford University) and tub-GAL80ts from Bloomington Fly Center. The
genetic backgrounds for all stocks were Cantonized by outcrossing their
heterozygous virgins with w1118 (iso1CJ) males for six generations.
Antibody production and western blotting. Rabbit antibodies to dNR1 have
been described previously1 or are described in Supplementary Figs. 1 and 2.
Rabbit polyclonal antibodies to dNR2 were raised against various peptides
corresponding to different regions of dNR2 (Supplementary Figs. 1 and 2).
Western analysis was carried out as previously described1. In brief, adult
heads were homogenized with lysis buffer, centrifuged at 14,000 rpm at 4 1C for
50 min, and the supernatant was saved. Lysate proteins were electrophoresed on
a 6% SDS-PAGE gel and then electroblotted onto PVDF membranes. Immobilized proteins were probed with a rabbit polyclonal antibody to dNR1 (a-85S
at 1:5,000 dilution) polyclonal antibodies to dNR2 (a-820-2 at 1:5,000 dilution,
a-820-1 at 1:5,000 dilution or a-84S at 1:5,000 dilution) or a mouse monoclonal antibody to actin (1:2,500 dilution, Developmental Studies Hybridoma
Bank) as a loading controls and the membrane was incubated with HRPconjugated goat antibody to rabbit (1:10,000 dilution) or mouse (1:5,000
dilution) IgG. The positive signal was visualized with Qentix Western signal
enhancer and SS West Pico Substrate detection (Pierce).
Behavior. Olfactory associative learning was measured by training 2–3-day-old
adult flies in a T-maze with a Pavlovian conditioning procedure48. Groups of
about 100 flies received one or ten sessions of massed or spaced training
during which they were exposed sequentially to one odor (conditioned stimulus,
CS+; 3-octanol or 4-methyl-cyclohexanol) paired with electric shock and
then to a second odor (CS; 4-methyl-cyclohexanol or 3-octanol) without
eletric shock. Learning was measured immediately after one training session1
.
We tested 3-h memory after one training session8. We evaluated 1-d or 4-d
memory after spaced or massed training, which induces strong, long-lasting
memory for conditioned avoidance8. Spaced training consisted of ten cycles
of one session of training with a 15-min rest interval between each cycle.
Massed training consisted of ten cycles of one session of training with no rest
interval between each. Afterwards, flies were tested for memory retention of
conditioned avoidance at the choice point of the T-maze after 1 or 4 d. A
performance index was calculated as the number of flies avoiding the CS+ minus
that avoiding the CS, divided by the total number of flies and finally mutiplied
by 100.
Heat-shock regimen. Heat shock induction was carried out according to an
established protocol with the same hs-GAL4 driver (P26)1.
Drug feeding. CXM feeding was carried out according to an established protocol8.
Statistics. As a result of the nature of their mathematical derivation, performance indexes are distributed normally. Hence, the data were evaluated via
one- or two-way ANOVAs. Subsequent pair-wise planned comparisons were
adjusted for experiment-wise error (a¢), keeping the overall a ¼ 0.05. All data
were presented as mean ± s.e.m.
Methods used for the generation of flies carrying UAS-dsNR1 and UASdsNR2 transgenes, antibody production, immunohistochemistry and imaging
whole-mount mCD8::GFP expression are described in the Supplementary
Methods online.
