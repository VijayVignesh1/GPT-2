Random change in cortical load representation
suggests distinct control of posture and movement
Isaac Kurtzer1, Troy M Herter1 & Stephen H Scott
Accurately maintaining a fixed limb posture and quickly moving between postures underlies both everyday skills, including holding
and lifting a cup of coffee, and expert skills, such as an Olympic wrestler’s holding and throwing an opponent. A fundamental
question in limb motor control is whether the brain manages these contrasting goals of posture and movement through a single,
robust control process or whether each engages a specialized control process. We addressed this question by examining how
individual neurons in the primary motor cortex of macaque monkeys represent mechanical loads during posture and movement
tasks. Notably, approximately half of the neurons that expressed load-related activity did so exclusively during either posture only
or movement only. Further, those neurons with load-related activity during both tasks randomly switched their magnitude of
response between tasks. These random changes in load representation suggest specialized control processes, one for posture
and one for movement.

A fundamental and unresolved question in motor control research is
whether posture and movement involve similar1–4 or specialized5–7
neural control processes. The use of a similar control process has the
advantage of generality and conserved neural circuitry. This is exemplified by equilibrium point control1,4, in which movement results
from shifts in postural references with the detailed force requirements
delegated to peripheral reflex control and intrinsic muscle stiffness. In
contrast, using specialized control processes for posture and movement
tasks has the advantage of context dependency and flexibility, as
exemplified by using multiple internal models5,8 or an optimal feedback controller9,10, but requires circuitries with greater functional
dedication and expertise. Determining which strategy is used by an
organism is basic to understanding both posture and movement
control and to explaining how the limb motor system weighs the
conflicting requirements of generality and flexibility.
Behavioral evidence bearing on this question has been equivocal,
with researchers disagreeing whether the modulation of limb stiffness during movement3,11,12, motor adaptation to new movementdependent forces4,6,13,14 and patterns of movement accuracy7 reflect the
operation of distinct control processes or of a more unified and robust
control process that supports both posture and movement. Likewise,
changes in reflex15,16 and perceptual function17 have been observed
between posture and movement, but these data cannot indicate how
descending motor commands treat these distinct tasks.
A more direct approach is to analyze the underlying neural commands during motor control such that as in primary motor cortex
(M1), the principal cortical region for voluntary motor execution18,19.
Researchers have observed changes in the activity of individual M1
neurons during different hand grips20, between ramp and hold

movements and ramp and hold isometric forces of the wrist21, and
between whole-limb isometric and movement tasks22. However, these
alterations in neuron activity could have reflected many different
factors, including changes in the musculature involved in the task or
changes in movement kinematics.
Appropriately comparing neural processing during posture and
movement is difficult because the two tasks involve inherently different
kinematics—one is stationary and the other is moving. This difficulty
can be resolved by instead comparing the neurons’ representations of
mechanical loads, a salient non-movement feature, during posture and
movement tasks. Previous work has shown that load-related activity in
M1 is highly predictable between single- and multijoint loads in both
posture23 and movement24 tasks, suggesting that a neuron’s role in
motor control remains invariant within posture tasks and within
movement tasks. If individual neurons also maintain a similar role
across movement and posture tasks, then their responses to mechanical
loads should be invariant across tasks. In contrast, substantial changes
in load-related activity between tasks would indicate a shift in the
neurons’ role in each task. In two experiments, we observed significant
changes in M1 neurons’ load-related activity between posture and
movement tasks, providing evidence for specialized control of posture
and movement.
RESULTS
Experiment 1: Separate posture and reaching tasks
In this study, 94 M1 neurons associated with proximal forelimb control
were recorded from four monkeys (monkeys A–D, n ¼ 26, 24, 31 and
13, respectively) during separate posture and reaching tasks involving
joint-based load compensation (Methods). Each task was performed

reflect influences of the mechanical load (Supplementary Note and
Supplementary Fig. 1 online).
As observed previously21,26–29, M1 neurons expressed a wide range
of responses to the loads. In both tasks, roughly half the cells showed
significant load-related responses (posture task: 50/94; reaching task:
53/94); this was determined by analyzing their change in activity during
the loaded conditions relative to the unloaded condition with a planar
regression model, P o 0.01 (Methods). The absolute magnitude
of these responses, or response gain, ranged from very low to high
firing rates (posture task, 1152 HzN1m1; reaching task,
16194 HzN1m1). Likewise, the neurons varied in what load
direction evoked the largest response, termed the response direction,
as a neuron could express changes in discharge preferentially related to
elbow loads, shoulder loads or both. In both tasks we observed a
nonuniform representation of response directions biased toward
whole-limb flexion and extension muscle torques (Rayleigh bimodal
test: P o 0.01 and P o 0.001, respectively)23.
If these load-related neurons formed a single cortical controller for
both posture and movement, they should have similar load-related
activity in both tasks. Instead, we observed a broad breakdown among
each possible category: load-related activity during posture only
(21/94), reaching only (24/94), both tasks (29/94) and neither task
(20/94), (Figs. 1 and 2a). Notably, most neurons that were load-related
only during the posture task were also tuned to the direction of hand
motion during reaching (16/21, 76%); that is, these neurons were
systematically modulated during reaching, but were insensitive to the
task’s mechanical requirements (Fig. 1, right column). Additionally, the
observed categorical breakdown among neurons did not mirror that of
the proximal forelimb muscles. Virtually all shoulder and elbow
muscles (97%) expressed some load-related activity and a larger
percentage of these (64%) were load-related in both tasks than for
M1 neurons (34%) (w2 ¼ 16.9, P o 0.001; Fig. 2a).
We examined the response gain and response direction of neurons
with load-related activity in both tasks to assess several putative
relationships between neural activity and behavior. Similarity in
response gain and response direction would suggest an underlying
tight association in the control of the two tasks. In contrast, random
changes in both response gain and response direction tuning would
suggest a more labile, and consequently complex, link between cortical
processing and the motor periphery. Lastly, random changes in
response gain paired with invariance in response direction would
suggest that neurons maintain a constant relative association to a

a

portion of the motor periphery (that is, shoulder, elbow or some
combination of the two), but with an absolute contribution that varies
with the behavioral context.
Similarity in response gain was assessed by a linear correlation of the
gains measured for each task; a high or low correlation indicates that
the neurons make a similar or random contribution across tasks,
respectively. We found negligible intertask gain correlations when we
examined neurons tuned in either task or those tuned in both tasks
(reither ¼ 0.02, P 4 0.05; rboth ¼ 0.13, P 4 0.05; Fig. 2b). Therefore, the
absolute contribution of individual neurons varied greatly across
posture and movement tasks; alternative measures of neural gain also
produced very low correlations across tasks (Supplementary Note and
Supplementary Fig. 2 online).
Response direction was assessed by subtracting each cell’s response
direction in the posture task from its response direction in the reaching
task. If response directions were maintained between tasks, then their
absolute angular difference would be smaller than that of random
pairings. Notably, and in contrast to what was observed for response
gain, we found a neuron’s response direction is generally conserved
across tasks (mean absolute difference ¼ 521 versus random B901,
bootstrap P o 104; Fig. 2c).
The observed difference in the neurons’ intertask gain and direction
correlations did not reflect a difference in the reliability of the measures,
as both showed high intratask reliability (Supplementary Note and
Supplementary Fig. 3 online). Also, the neural responses did not
entirely parallel the muscular responses. Unlike the neurons, both
response gain and direction were conserved between posture and
movement in muscles (response gain: rboth ¼ 0.81, P o 0.001; response
direction: mean absolute difference ¼ 281 versus random B901,
bootstrap P o 104). Muscular response gains were also higher during
the reaching task, presumably to compensate for the force-velocity
relationship of muscle30,31 (slope ¼ 3.45, P o 0.001). Therefore,
neurons retained a constant relative association with the motor
periphery, although their absolute contribution was highly variable
between tasks.
Experiment 2: Integrated posture and reaching task
In the experiment described above, we perturbed the monkey’s limb
with constant and viscous loads during the posture and reaching tasks,
respectively. Consequently, our observation of a substantial change in
load representation could have arisen from either a difference between
the two tasks per se or a difference in the two types of loads

were load-related in both epochs or not load-related in both epochs. In
contrast, a score of 1 signified that all neurons ‘flipped’ their contribution between epochs, being load-related during one epoch and not
load-related in the other (Fig. 4a).
Not surprisingly, the similarity score, response gain correlation
and response direction correlation remained high before target
onset because the two epochs overlapped in time. Then, during the
reaction time period, the similarity score rapidly decreased to a value
similar to random chance throughout the movement time period
(bootstrap P 4 0.01). The correlation in response gain between
the two epochs also showed a corresponding drop during the reaction
time period (Fig. 4b, solid line). In contrast, response direction
was highly conserved across the reaction and movement time periods
(Fig. 4b, dashed line). Near the end of the movement, the similarity
score gradually returned close to its initial value, although the
correlation in response gain did not reach premovement levels. That
is, cells which expressed load-related activity at the central posture also
tended to have load-related activity at the peripheral postures but
with an altered response gain, probably owing to the influence
of arm position28,35. The response direction at the peripheral

used. Possibly one neural population was primarily sensitive to constant loads whereas another was primarily sensitive to viscous loads.
Separate representations for different types of mechanical loads would
allow a flexible control strategy and is consistent with some human
behavioral studies8,32–34.
We addressed this possibility with an experiment involving a single
type of mechanical load applied during both posture and movement
(monkey D, n ¼ 95). In each trial the monkey countered a constant
load applied to the shoulder, elbow, both or neither joint during a
prereach postural period and continued to counter this constant load
while reaching from the central target to one of two peripheral targets
(see Methods). By comparing each neuron’s load-related activity
during a 1-s premovement postural period (epoch 1) with a 200-ms
sliding window (epoch 2), we could observe how load-related activity
evolved between behavioral contexts.
As before, we found exemplar neurons with load-related activity
only during posture, only during reaching, during both periods and
during neither period (Fig. 3). These across-epoch categorizations were
summarized with a similarity score between 1 and –1. Akin to a
categorical correlation, a similarity score of 1 signified that all neurons

postures was highly correlated with the response direction at the
central posture.
Notably, the one study28 that had used a constant (hand-based) load
during a posture and movement task reported high correlations
in both direction and gain when the entire movement time (gain,
rMT ¼ 0.51–0.86 across monkeys) or the combined reaction and
movement time (gain, rRT+MT ¼ 0.65–0.90) were analyzed. However,
early reaction-time and late movement-time activity can relate to
postural control before and after movement, respectively36, and when
we used similar time windows, we also observed elevated gain correlations (rMT ¼ 0.4 and rRT+MT ¼ 0.58).
In summary, M1 neurons maintain a constant relative association with the motor periphery during both posture and movement, but their absolute contribution varies randomly across these
behavioral contexts.
DISCUSSION
In this study we found a profound shift in load-related cortical
processing during posture and movement, providing direct evidence
for distinct control processes underlying the two behaviors. In the
extreme, individual neurons can provide exquisite information on
mechanical loads during posture and only reflect kinematic features
during movement. These data are inconsistent with the notion that the
control of movement is generated by shifts in positional control.
Rather, there is an abrupt switch in neural processing in M1 starting
just before the transition from a stationary posture to movement,
consistent with task-dependent control strategies such as multiple
internal models5,8 and optimal feedback control9,10. It is likely that
this change in neural processing is linked to previous observations that
cortical field potentials are phase-locked to muscle field potentials
during posture and diminish markedly upon movement37.
It was possible that a task-dependent change in neural processing
in M1 would invoke distinct and dedicated populations of neurons.
For example, the observation that neurons can be qualitatively categorized as ‘phasic’ or ‘tonic’ in nature21 could be assumed to reflect the fact
that those in the former class are involved in dynamic control and those
in the latter class in postural control. If posture and movement were
supported by only two unique sets of neurons, the similarity score we
obtained (Fig. 4a) should have become strongly negative during
movement, reflecting a flip between these unique neural populations.
Instead, the similarity score hovered within random levels during
movement, reflecting the comparable presence of neurons expressing
load-related activity exclusively to one task and those with load-related
activity in both or neither task.

Most notably, those neurons with load-related activity in both tasks
expressed random changes in their response gain, and hence their
absolute contribution, between tasks. This random gain change
strongly supports the notion of distinct control processes for posture
and movement. Although it has been demonstrated that postural gain
can change depending on the expected range of forces, this effect is
modest and appears to be a systematic rather than a random change
across conditions29.
In contrast to the random change in response gain across posture
and movement, the present work also illustrates that the response
direction—that is, the preferred direction in muscle-torque space—was
highly conserved across conditions. For example, if a neuron increases
its activity for elbow flexor loads but is unresponsive to shoulder loads
during posture, then this relative pattern of load-related activity is
retained during movement. This invariance in response direction
tuning would be expected if neurons maintained a fixed relative
association with a group of limb muscles38,39.
The present load-compensation protocol exposed a task-dependent
change in the motor network for posture and for movement control.
Future studies could use analogous load-compensation paradigms
to determine whether M1 or other brain regions express additional
task-dependent networks—possibly underlying rhythmic40 or tracking
limb motions.
With regard to clinical relevance, specialized control of posture and
movement may explain why some neurological disorders result in
difficulties associated with only one of the two states, or with transitions between these states, as with different types of tremors41 and
Parkinson disease42, respectively. Practically, this work illustrates a
potential challenge for developing neuroprosthetics to guide artificial
motor actions. Whereas cortex-driven prostheses traditionally assume
a fixed correlation between neural activity and motor output43,44,
shifts in load representation across behavioral tasks suggest that
using a single algorithm would be suboptimal. Separate algorithms
may be necessary to associate neural activity related to posture and to
movement as well as a decisional process to identify transitions between
behavioral contexts.
METHODS
Experiments. Four male rhesus monkeys (Macaca mulatta, 6–12 kg) were
treated according to approved guidelines of the Queen’s University Animal
Care Committee. The monkeys were trained to counter flexion and extension
loads applied at the shoulder and elbow joints by a robotic exoskeleton
(KINARM, BKIN Technologies, Kingston, Canada) that allowed horizontal
planar movement25. The entire limb remained visible, and the start and target

positions were presented as small circles in the movement plane through a
virtual reality system.
Experiment 1 involved separate posture and reaching tasks as described in
previous studies23,24. Posture task: monkeys maintained their right hand within
the central target window (0.8-cm radius) for B3 s while countering a constant
flexion or extension torque at the shoulder, elbow, both or neither joint
(monkeys A–C, 70.12 Nm; monkey D, 70.32 Nm). A total of 9 load
conditions were presented in a pseudorandom block design, with each
block repeated 5 times, for 45 trials total. Reaching task: monkeys moved
their right hand from a central start window to eight (or, for monkey C only,
two) peripheral targets (1-cm radius) distributed radially, with equal amplitude
(6 cm) within 220–350 ms. Targets were presented in a pseudorandom
block design, with each block repeated 6 (or 10) times, for 48 (or 20) trials
total, respectively. In each reach set, the monkeys countered a velocitydependent torque that impeded joint motion at the shoulder, elbow, both or
neither joint (0.2 Nradms1). Load conditions were presented in a blocked
design with a pseudorandom order between targets, which allowed the
monkeys to adapt to each load after the first block; the initial trial was dropped
from analysis. Monkeys A–C reached under all load conditions, whereas
Monkey D reached in the ‘no load’ and ‘both joints loaded’ conditions only.
Experiment 2 (monkey D only) involved a combined task with both postural
and reaching periods. Constant torques identical to those used in the earlier
posture task in Experiment 1 were used (70.32 Nm) while the monkey
maintained his right hand at the start position for B2 s, then reached to one of
two targets (at 901 and 2701), and finally maintained his position at the target
for another B1.5 s. The 18 load conditions (9 loads for each target) were
presented in a pseudorandom block design with each block repeated 5 times for
a total of 90 trials per set.
Cell and muscle recording. Standard neurophysiological techniques were used
for extracellular recordings in the shoulder-elbow region of M1 (refs. 24,28).
Electromyographic activity of proximal forelimb muscles was recorded in all
four monkeys during Experiment 1. These included percutaneous and chronic
recordings, for a total of 39 samples (see Supplementary Note).
Data analysis. Neuron and muscle activity were quantified by the mean change
in spike rate and mean change in rectified voltage between the loaded and
unloaded conditions for each task. In Experiment 1, the posture task used
activity from final 2 s of hold; the reaching task used activity from movement
onset to peak hand velocity. In experiment 2, epoch 1/premovement postural
period used activity from 1,000 ms prior to target onset; epoch 2/sliding
window used activity from the 200-ms window that was successively shifted in
5-ms steps across the pre-, peri- and postmovement time periods.
Muscle torque was estimated using the equations of motion for a two-joint
system including the influence of mechanical properties of the limb and robotic
device25. In all tasks, changes in muscle torque were calculated as the difference
in mean elbow and shoulder muscle torque relative to the unloaded condition.
For Experiment 2, we examined the load-related activity for the target that
elicited the highest activity during unloaded reaching owing to the coupling of
a neuron’s preferred hand direction and load sensitivity24.
Load-related responses were assessed by a plane-fit of the change in neuron
and muscle activity versus the change in shoulder and elbow muscle torque;
acceptance level was P o 0.01. The shoulder (S) and elbow (E) slope
coefficients yielded two measures used throughout the experiments: response
direction (atan(E/S)) and response gain (E2 + S2)1/2 . We performed a number
of tests to ensure that both measures were highly reliable (see Supplementary
Note). Further, several alternative measures of response gain and response
direction provided similar results (see Supplementary Note). The similarity
score obtained in Experiment 2 (Fig. 4a) was defined as the number of cells that
retained the same load-related activity as flagged by the plane-fit (both and
neither sensitive) minus the number of cells sensitive to loads in only one of the
epochs (epoch 1 only and epoch 2 only) divided by the total number of cells.
Mean and confidence interval for a random similarity score were derived from

When comparing neural processing across tasks we used standard linear
