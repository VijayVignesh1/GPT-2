Dopamine neurotransmission in the dorsal hippocampus is critical
for a range of functions from spatial learning and synaptic plasticity
to the deficits underlying psychiatric disorders such as attentiondeficit hyperactivity disorder. The ventral tegmental area (VTA) is
the presumed source of dopamine in the dorsal hippocampus.
However, there is a surprising scarcity of VTA dopamine axons
in the dorsal hippocampus despite the dense network of dopamine
receptors. We have explored this apparent paradox using optogenetic, biochemical, and behavioral approaches and found that
dopaminergic axons and subsequent dopamine release in the dorsal
hippocampus originate from neurons of the locus coeruleus (LC).
Photostimulation of LC axons produced an increase in dopamine
release in the dorsal hippocampus as revealed by high-performance
liquid chromatography. Furthermore, optogenetically induced release
of dopamine from the LC into the dorsal hippocampus enhanced
selective attention and spatial object recognition via the dopamine
D1/D5 receptor. These results suggest that spatial learning and
memory are energized by the release of dopamine in the dorsal
hippocampus from noradrenergic neurons of the LC. The present
findings are critical for identifying the neural circuits that enable
proper attention selection and successful learning and memory.
dopamine | locus coeruleus | hippocampus | memory | attention
Dopamine is a neurotransmitter released throughout the brain
to encode salience and facilitate the formation of associative
memory (1, 2). When released into the dorsal hippocampus, dopamine binds to D1/D5 receptors to promote attention, episodic
memory formation, spatial learning, and synaptic plasticity (3–5).
Successful spatial learning requires that hippocampal place cells,
location-encoding pyramidal neurons (6), display consistent and
stable patterns of neural activity, a process that can be enhanced
by selective attention to spatial cues and by dopamine agonists
(7, 8). Conversely, dopamine receptor blockade attenuates the
ability of spatial attention to stabilize the firing pattern of hippocampal place cells (8). The role of dopamine in driving attentional processes is highlighted by the fact that methylphenidate,
one of the most common treatments for attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), improves attention by increasing synaptic availability of dopamine in the hippocampus, as well as in the
prefrontal cortex and striatum (9–11). These findings suggest that
dopamine is critical for the selective attention underlying spatial
learning and memory.
For decades, the ventral tegmental area (VTA) has been the
presumed source of hippocampal dopamine. However, in recent
years, the source of dopamine in the dorsal hippocampus has
become less clear. McNamara et al. (12) argued that a dopaminergic projection from the VTA to the dorsal hippocampus
promoted hippocampal reactivation during sleep and stabilized
memory. However, only 10% of the sparse projection from the
VTA to the hippocampus contains dopamine, raising the question
of whether this weak VTA projection could be solely responsible
for activating the dense network of dopamine receptors found in
the dorsal hippocampus (13–16). Moreover, whereas the ventral
aspect of the hippocampus, an area associated with learned fear
and anxiety (17), receives significant dopaminergic projections
from the VTA (13, 14), the dorsal region of the hippocampus,
which houses the place cells required for spatial memory (7), has
relatively sparse dopaminergic innervation from the VTA. We
therefore set out to identify the neurons that provide dopaminergic tone to the dorsal hippocampus and to assess their
involvement in spatial learning and attention.
Dopamine is removed from hippocampal synapses by the
norepinephrine transporter (18), which suggests that dopamine
may also be released from norepinephrine-containing neurons
outside of the VTA. Although indirect action via the VTA had
not been ruled out, electrical and pharmacological stimulation of
the noradrenergic locus coeruleus (LC) increased dopamine
levels in the prefrontal cortex and modulated hippocampal synaptic transmission (19, 20). Also, dopamine-mediated enhancement of excitatory transmission in the hippocampus can be
reversed by tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) knockdown in the LC, but
not in the VTA (21). Smith and Greene (21) therefore suggested
that dopamine may be released from the LC into the dorsal
hippocampus. A major caveat of the study is that the synaptic
transmission effects are produced in vitro by amphetamine, a
Significance
Successful completion of daily activities relies on the ability to
select the relevant features of the environment to pay attention to and remember. Disruptions of these processes can lead
to disorders, such as attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder
and age-related memory loss. To devise therapeutic strategies,
we must understand the neural circuits underlying normal
cognition. One important pathway is the signaling of dopamine, a reinforcement-related neurotransmitter, in the hippocampus, a spatial learning and memory center. Surprisingly,
the brain region supplying dopamine to the dorsal hippocampus is unclear. This study provides direct evidence that the
noradrenergic locus coeruleus coreleases dopamine in the
dorsal hippocampus and provides insight into dopamine function in selective attention and spatial learning and memory.

drug known to increase extracellular dopamine concentrations
(22). The finding provides no insight as to whether dopamine is
released from the LC under more physiological, nondrug conditions, a question we test directly in our study.
Taken together, there are some groups who argue that the
VTA is the main source of dopamine to the dorsal hippocampus
(12–14) and others who support the idea that dopamine is released from LC neurons (19–21). These conflicting hypotheses
leave unanswered the question of which brain region supplies
the dorsal hippocampus with dopaminergic tone. We combined
optogenetic, biochemical, and behavioral methods to identify the
major source of dopamine in the dorsal hippocampus and then
examined the involvement of this dopaminergic pathway in selective attention and spatial learning and memory.
Results
VTA Dopamine Neurons Project More Widely to the Ventral Versus
Dorsal Hippocampus. To identify the neurons that release dopamine in the dorsal aspect of the hippocampus, we first selectively
labeled and then stimulated dopamine axons in the dorsal hippocampus using the neuronal specificity afforded by optogenetics.
Using the Cre-Lox method for gene expression, we used mice that
expressed Cre under control of the dopamine transporter with an
internal ribosome entry site (IRES-Cre mice). We then transfected dopaminergic cell bodies in the VTA and their axonal
projections by injecting a floxed adenoassociated virus coding for
Channelrhodopsin-2 (ChR2), a light-sensitive ion channel coupled
to enhanced yellow fluorescent protein (EYFP), a fluorescent reporter gene (Fig. 1 A and B). The genetic precision of optogenetics
eliminates the possibility of nonspecific binding and injection site
spillover that can accompany classical immunohistochemical techniques. To map dopamine axonal projections, we imaged ChR2-
EYFP–expressing VTA dopamine axons and immunostained for
TH (Fig. 1 C and D), an enzyme in the pathway for dopamine
synthesis that highlights catecholaminergic structures (23). Confirming the efficacy of our cell type-specific labeling method, we observed
fibers in expected VTA projection sites, including the striatum and
amygdala (Fig. S1A), as well as in the ventral hippocampus (Fig.
1D). However, we found very sparse expression of VTA dopamine
axons in the cortical area 1 (CA1) region of the dorsal hippocampus (Fig. 1C). We observed a significantly greater number of
VTA axons in the ventral versus dorsal hippocampus (Fig. 1E).
We repeated the procedure of tracing the VTA to the dorsal
hippocampus projection using Th-IRES-Cre mice and similar to
results in DAT-IRES-Cre mice, we found scarce expression of
VTA dopamine axons in the dorsal hippocampus. However,
upon inspection of the midbrain, we also observed ChR2-EYFP
viral expression in neurons outside of VTA dopamine cells, and
therefore eliminated the dataset (Fig. S1B). Indeed, it has previously been reported that Cre-induced reporter expression in
the midbrain of Th-IRES-Cre and Th-Cre mice is nonspecific for
VTA dopamine neurons (24).
Catecholamine Neurons of the LC Project to the Dorsal Hippocampus.
To explore the source of dopamine to the dorsal hippocampus,
we used retrograde tracing to locate the cell bodies of catecholamine neurons that project directly to the dorsal hippocampus (Fig. 1 F and G). We injected red retrobeads into the
dorsal CA1 region of the hippocampus in naive C57BL/6 mice
and did not label dopamine cell bodies in the VTA, providing
further evidence that the catecholamine projection from the VTA
to the dorsal hippocampus is sparse at best (Fig. 1G). In contrast,
the retrobeads fluorescently labeled significantly more catecholamine neurons in the LC (Fig. 1H), another brain region related
to attention and arousal (25, 26). Unlike the VTA, which contains
neurons that release dopamine, cells of the LC are thought to
produce dopamine solely as an intermediate in the synthesis of
norepinephrine (27). We now hypothesize that LC neurons
corelease dopamine along with norepinephrine in the dorsal
hippocampus.
To determine whether the catecholamine terminals of the LC
are appropriately positioned to influence hippocampal activity,
we next isolated and mapped the catecholamine pathway from
the LC to the dorsal hippocampus in Th-IRES-Cre mice. The LC
projection to the hippocampus (28), specifically to the ventral
hippocampus, has been documented (29); however, the anatomical localization of LC catecholamine terminals within distinct
dorsal hippocampal subregions has not been well characterized.
Using ChR2-EYFP as a neuronal label, we found that catecholamine neurons in the LC indeed send numerous axons to the
dorsal hippocampus (Fig. 2 A and B). Given that place cells are
found in the CA1 and CA3 regions in the dorsal hippocampus (6),
we quantified LC terminal expression in these hippocampal subregions (schematic in Fig. 2C). We found dense LC catecholamine

fiber expression throughout the dorsal CA1 region (Fig. 2D).
This finding suggests that LC catecholamine fibers terminate in
close proximity to the dendritic branches of hippocampal place
cells, neurons that encode position in space and are tuned
by selective attention to environmental cues (7, 8). We next
compared the density of LC catecholamine axons with the
density of VTA dopamine axons in the dorsal CA1 region and
found that LC axons are substantially denser than VTA fibers
(Fig. 2E).
Previous studies support the hypothesis that LC neurons are
capable of coreleasing dopamine in the dorsal hippocampus.
Electrical stimulation of the LC produces increased tissue content and pharmacological action of dopamine in the hippocampus (20, 30). However, these studies did not rule out network
action via the VTA and failed to demonstrate release of dopamine from noradrenergic LC axons into the dorsal hippocampus.
An increase in dopamine tissue content may suggest intracellular accumulation of norepinephrine synthesis products, but
does not provide evidence that these neurons are capable of
dopamine release. We attempted to address these unresolved
questions using the genetic and anatomical specificity afforded
by optogenetics.
Dopamine Is Released from Axons of the LC in the Dorsal Hippocampus.
To assess directly whether and to what extent dopamine is released
from axons of the LC, we measured extracellular dopamine concentrations in acute hippocampal slices using high-performance
liquid chromatography (HPLC). Dorsal hippocampus coronal brain
sections (250 μm) were prepared from Th-IRES-Cre mice in which
LC catecholamine neurons and fibers were infected with the
floxed ChR2-EYFP virus. We then photostimulated LC axons
in the hippocampus ex vivo and compared dopamine release in
the extracellular fluid of stimulated hippocampal slices with
identically handled wild-type controls lacking ChR2 expression.
Optical stimulation of LC catecholamine terminals in the
dorsal hippocampus evoked significantly higher levels of both
dopamine and norepinephrine release compared with controls
(Fig. 3A). Similarly, optically stimulated slices (laser on)
showed significantly higher extracellular concentrations of dopamine and norepinephrine than nonstimulated slices expressing
ChR2-EYFP (laser off; Fig. 3 B and C). These findings confirm
that both neurotransmitters were released from LC axons into
the dorsal hippocampus.
We next lesioned catecholamine neurons of the LC selectively
using a floxed Caspase-3 virus (University of North Carolina
Vector Core) (31) and measured a 72.7% reduction of dopamine
and a 77.2% reduction of norepinephrine tissue levels in the
hippocampus (Fig. 3 D and E). The ratio of norepinephrine to
dopamine remained the same in lesioned and control samples
(Fig. 3E). We then stimulated nonspecific neurotransmitter release into the extracellular fluid by incubating slices in potassium
chloride to promote release of dopamine and norepinephrine
from all axons in the dorsal hippocampus. A selective lesion of
LC catecholamine neurons reduced the extracellular dopamine
concentration by 67.9% and norepinephrine by 83.8% (Fig. S2).
This finding suggests that the majority of the dopaminergic tone
present in dorsal hippocampal tissue and actively released into
the extracellular space originated from neurons of the LC. Together, these results provide a direct demonstration that dopamine is released from LC axons into the dorsal hippocampus.
Optogenetic Activation of LC Catecholamine Axons in the Dorsal
Hippocampus Promotes Selective Attention and Spatial Learning via
the Dopamine D1/D5 Receptor. To assess the behavioral significance of the dopamine pathway from the LC to the hippocampus, we examined mice in a spatial object recognition task while
activating ChR2-EYFP+ LC axons in the dorsal hippocampus
(Fig. 4A). We allowed mice to explore a square arena with distinct walls containing two identical objects during a 5-min
training session. One day later, we challenged these mice to
explore the arena during a 5-min test session in which the least
preferred object was moved to another position. During the
training session for this task, both ChR2-EYFP–expressing
Th-IRES-Cre animals and their wild-type controls received
intrahippocampal optical stimulation. We then assessed performance by determining the difference index, a normalized
measure indicating the relative amount of time spent exploring
the displaced object. Increased attention to the displaced object during the test session generates a higher difference index
and correlates positively with the degree of successful spatial
learning and memory. In ChR2-EYFP–expressing animals,
optical activation of hippocampal LC catecholamine terminals
during training significantly increased the average difference
index in the test session. This enhancement of spatial learning
only occurred in optically stimulated animals, and not in wild-type
controls (Fig. 4B). These results demonstrate that photostimulation
of the LC-to-hippocampus catecholamine pathway promoted
spatial learning and converted nonlearners into learners.
The LC-to-hippocampus projection was previously thought to
be strictly noradrenergic (28); therefore, the function of dopamine
released from LC fibers into the dorsal hippocampus was not
known. Given the dearth of catecholamine innervation from the
VTA, we now asked whether the LC actively releases behaviorally relevant dopamine concentrations into the dorsal hippocampus. To address this question, before the optical stimulation
training session, we infused into the dorsal hippocampus one of
three compounds: (i) saline; (ii) SCH23390, a dopamine D1/D5
receptor antagonist we have previously used to block the effects

of attention on place cell stability (8); or (iii) propranolol, a betaadrenergic receptor antagonist. Site-specific delivery (Fig. S3) of
the dopamine D1/D5 receptor antagonist blocked the memoryenhancing effects of LC-to-hippocampus photostimulation, consistent
with the hypothesis that LC neurons do, in fact, release dopamine
into the dorsal hippocampus to promote spatial learning and
memory (Fig. 4C). The norepinephrine antagonist had no significant effect on the LC-to-hippocampus optical stimulation-induced
learning enhancement (Fig. 4C). Given that the difference index is
a normalized measure of activity and that total exploration times in
antagonist experiments were not significantly different from baseline experiments, it is highly unlikely that this effect was due to
alterations in locomotion (Fig. 4D).
Optogenetic Activation of LC Catecholamine Axons in the Dorsal
Hippocampus Increases the Rate of Spatial Learning and Memory.
To explore the role of the catecholaminergic projection from the
LC to the dorsal hippocampus in spatial learning and memory
further, we also performed the Barnes Maze task. In this
hippocampus-dependent paradigm, animals explore a circular
platform with equidistant holes surrounding the periphery (Fig.
5A). One hole leads to an escape box, which, when entered, turns
off the aversive bright lights. Animals received optical stimulation of LC axons in the dorsal hippocampus during each of the
daily training sessions. After 6 d of training, the escape box
was removed and optical stimulation was discontinued to test
the memory retention for the target hole. Optical stimulation

followed by a second probe day. Animals were connected to a
fiber optic cable that did not deliver photostimulation on probe
days. LC-to-hippocampus–stimulated animals learned this task
significantly better than controls during probe test 1, as indicated
by a fewer number of errors, shorter latency to the target hole,
and more time spent in the target quadrant (Fig. 5B). By probe
test 2, control animals had sufficiently learned the task, yielding
no significant difference between the two groups (Fig. 5C).
These findings demonstrate that in a task learned by control
animals, activation of LC axons in the dorsal hippocampus of
ChR2-expressing mice significantly increased the rate of learning. These results reinforce earlier findings and support the
idea that dopamine release from the LC to the dorsal hippocampus is a significant component of the spatial learning and
memory circuit.
Optogenetic Activation of LC Catecholamine Axons in the Dorsal
Hippocampus Had No Effect on a Modified Conditioned Place
Preference Task. To assess whether photostimulation of the LCto-hippocampus catecholamine pathway is inherently reinforcing, we performed a conditioned place preference task modified
to increase involvement of hippocampus-dependent spatial
learning circuits. Animals explored a circular chamber with cues
surrounding the walls for spatial orientation. We delivered photostimulation each time the animal explored an unmarked target
quadrant of the arena (Fig. 6A). This spatial version of conditioned place preference was designed to assay whether the LC-tohippocampus pathway provided reinforcement in the absence of
selective attention to a specific object or goal. Optically stimulated animals did not display a significant change in the amount
of time spent in the unmarked target region versus wild-type
controls (Fig. 6B). This finding is consistent with the argument
that LC-to-hippocampus stimulation enhances selective attention
to specific stimuli, thereby energizing spatial learning and memory. This result demonstrates that dopamine signaling in the dorsal
hippocampus did not produce an inherently rewarding or reinforcing signal but, instead, promoted selective attention to salient
environmental cues.
Discussion
These findings provide direct evidence that efferents from the
LC are not purely noradrenergic, but corelease dopamine in the
dorsal hippocampus. The LC dopamine signal drives the selective attention underlying spatial learning and memory. Numerous reports suggest that the VTA is the main source of dopamine
to the dorsal hippocampus (12–14), whereas others suggest that
the LC supplies the hippocampus with dopamine (19–21). The
present results reconcile the discrepancy between dense dopamine receptor expression and sparse VTA dopamine axon networks in the dorsal hippocampus and support the hypothesis that
dopaminergic tone in the dorsal hippocampus arises from neurons of the LC.
Previous work by McNamara et al. (12) demonstrated that
activation of VTA dopamine axons in the dorsal hippocampus
promoted spatial memory for a reward location. Our work adds
to these findings by suggesting that dopamine release from LC
neurons energizes the attention component of the spatial environment in the absence of reward and supports the acquisition of
spatial memory. Given that catecholamine neurons of the LC
contribute 73% of all measurable dopaminergic tone in the
dorsal hippocampus, we argue that dopamine release from the
LC may have more significant influence over dorsal hippocampus neuronal activity than the VTA.
Our findings that LC neurons corelease dopamine in the
dorsal hippocampus are consistent with the earlier finding that
LC neurons also corelease dopamine in the prefrontal cortex and
drive dopamine-dependent activity in the hippocampus (19, 21).
Moreover, the current findings provide anatomical support for
the documented functional distinctions between the dorsal and
ventral hippocampus (17). The density of VTA dopamine terminals in the ventral hippocampus, but sparse expression in the dorsal

NEUROSCIENCE
hippocampus, suggests that hippocampal subregion-dependent
behaviors are driven by different neuromodulatory pathways.
Specifically, LC catecholamine release may be the primary
source of synaptic modulation responsible for tuning the spaceencoding place cells found in the dorsal hippocampus. In contrast, VTA dopamine innervation in the ventral hippocampus
may provide the incentive salience and motivational drive underlying emotion-based learning.
The present findings also expand the list of dopamine-releasing
brain regions to include the LC. Numerous studies postulate dopamine release from the LC into the hippocampus, but rely on
pharmacological blockade of the dopamine D1/D5 receptor to
infer the presence of dopamine. However, the possibility exists
that the D1/D5 receptor is activated by a ligand other than dopamine or undergoes receptor–receptor interactions. Norepinephrine
has a Kd of 50 μM at the dopamine D1 receptor (32), and the
possibility exists that norepinephrine action at the dopamine D1
receptor is responsible for the effects reported by Smith and
Greene (21). In fact, norepinephrine promotes cAMP accumulation in embryonic retinas via the dopamine D1/D5 receptor
(33), and norepinephrine-induced increases in adenyl cyclase
activity in retinal homogenates can be reversed by the dopamine
D1/D5 receptor antagonist (34). In the present study, we use
biochemical approaches to directly demonstrate dopamine corelease from LC axons in the dorsal hippocampus.
One implication of our finding is that the peripheral signals that
carry information about arousal, novelty, stress, and sleep-wake
states may drive the release of dopamine in the dorsal hippocampus
as well as other LC projection sites, such as the prefrontal cortex
and amygdala. The current results further suggest that LC dopamine
release may play a role in energizing spatial learning and memory by
increasing attention to salient features of the environment. Activation of the LC-to-hippocampus pathway did not produce place
preference in the absence of salient environmental objects,
suggesting that photostimulation is not inherently reinforcing but
may promote selective attention to relevant cues in the given
setting. Finally, insofar as this work relates to attention and
memory it may prove helpful for identifying therapeutic targets of
dopamine- and norepinephrine-related disorders, such as ADHD.
