Rett syndrome is a severe neurodevelopmental disorder caused by
mutations in the methyl-CpG binding protein gene (MECP2). MeCP2
is a methyl-cytosine binding protein that is proposed to function as
a transcriptional repressor. However, multiple gene expression studies comparing wild-type and MeCP2-deficient neurons have failed to
identify gene expression changes consistent with loss of a classical
transcriptional repressor. Recent work suggests that one function of
MeCP2 in neurons is to temper the expression of the longest genes
in the genome by binding to methylated CA dinucleotides (mCA)
within transcribed regions of these genes. Here we explore the
mechanism of mCA and MeCP2 in fine tuning the expression of long
genes. We find that mCA is not only highly enriched within
the body of genes normally repressed by MeCP2, but also enriched
within extended megabase-scale regions surrounding MeCP2-repressed
genes. Whereas enrichment of mCA exists in a broad region around
these genes, mCA together with mCG within gene bodies appears to
be the primary driver of gene repression by MeCP2. Disruption of
methylation at CA sites within the brain results in depletion of
MeCP2 across genes that normally contain a high density of genebody mCA. We further find that the degree of gene repression by
MeCP2 is proportional to the total number of methylated cytosine
MeCP2 binding sites across the body of a gene. These findings suggest a model in which MeCP2 tunes gene expression in neurons by
binding within the transcribed regions of genes to impede the elongation of RNA polymerase.
DNA methylation | Rett syndrome | MeCP2 | transcription
Rett syndrome (RTT) is a severe neurodevelopmental disorder
characterized by developmental stagnation and regression,
stereotyped hand movements, seizures, and autism spectrum-like
behavior (1). RTT is caused by mutations in the gene encoding the
methyl-CpG binding protein 2 (MECP2) (1), and the monogenic
nature of RTT provides the unique opportunity to investigate the
molecular basis of a complex human neurodevelopmental disorder. One particularly useful approach for studying RTT has been
to generate mouse models that harbor RTT-causing mutations in
MeCP2. These RTT-like mice recapitulate many features of RTT
seen in humans, displaying defects in neural circuit excitatory–
inhibitory balance, increased incidence of seizures, motor discoordination, and breathing abnormalities (2, 3).
The onset of symptoms in girls with RTT and in mouse models of
the disorder occurs during a period of postnatal brain development
in which MeCP2 accumulates to exceedingly high levels in neurons
of the brain, such that the number of MeCP2 molecules in neurons
approaches the number of nucleosomes in adult neuronal nuclei (4).
Whereas MeCP2 is expressed to some extent in most cells of the
body, MeCP2 protein levels are approximately sevenfold higher in
neurons (4). Brain-specific disruption of MeCP2 is sufficient to cause
the vast majority of RTT-like phenotypes in mice, providing evidence
that RTT is predominantly a disorder of neuronal dysfunction (2, 3).
Key molecular functions of MeCP2 have been highlighted by the
observation that RTT-causing mutations largely cluster into two
functional domains: the methyl-DNA binding domain (MBD) and
the transcriptional repressor domain (TRD) (5). Bird and colleagues first identified MeCP2 on the basis of its high-affinity
binding to DNA containing mCG sequences and identified the
MBD of MeCP2 as essential for the high-affinity interaction between MeCP2 and methylcytosine (6, 7). For many years methylation of cytosines in the CpG dinucleotide context (mCG) has been
thought to represent the majority of DNA methylation in mammalian cells and to be the major site of MeCP2 binding in neurons.
It has recently been shown that in the brain, high levels of nonCG methylation (predominantly mCA) also contribute to the
neuronal “methylome,” with the number of mCA sites at late
stages of neuronal maturation approaching the number of mCG
sites (8–10). We, and others, have recently investigated whether
MeCP2 binds mCA sites and demonstrated that MeCP2 binds to
mCA and symmetrically methylated CG with similarly high affinity
(9, 11, 12). Thus, the number of possible sites of MeCP2 binding in
neurons increases significantly as mCA is laid down in the postnatal period. Given that the mCA mark is deposited at the time
that MeCP2 levels increase postnatally, and when the phenotype of
RTT syndrome is first observed in MeCP2 mutant mice, it has
been suggested that the disruption of MeCP2 binding to mCA in
neurons may be a key event in the etiology of RTT. Consistent with
this possibility, mutations that disrupt the function of Dnmt3a, the
de novo methyltransferase enzyme responsible for depositing mCA
in the brain, results in severe neurological deficits in mice that are
reminiscent of phenotypes observed in MeCP2 KO mice (13).
Furthermore, mutations in DNMT3A have been linked to intellectual disability and autism spectrum disorder in humans (14).
Considerable evidence supports the conclusion that when bound
to mC sequences, MeCP2 functions as a repressor of transcription.
Biochemical studies have demonstrated that the TRD of MeCP2
interacts with NCoR/SMRT and Sin3a corepressor complexes (5,
15). Notably, one of the most common non-MBD MeCP2 missense
Significance
Mutations in the methyl-CpG binding protein 2 (MECP2) lead to
the severe neurological disorder Rett syndrome, but our understanding of how MeCP2 regulates gene expression in the brain
has been limited. Recently we uncovered evidence that MeCP2
controls transcription of very long genes with critical neuronal
functions by binding a unique form of DNA methylation, enriched
in neurons. Here, we provide evidence that MeCP2 represses
transcription by binding within transcribed regions of genes. We
show that this repressive effect is proportional to the total number of methylated DNA binding sites for MeCP2 within each gene.
Our findings suggest a model in which MeCP2 represses transcription of long neuronal genes that contain many methylated
binding sites by impeding transcriptional elongation.

mutations that leads to RTT, MeCP2 R306C, disrupts the interaction between MeCP2 and NCoR, suggesting that a key
function of MeCP2 is to mediate transcriptional repression (5, 16).
Despite evidence that MeCP2 functions as a silencer of transcription, identifying the specific targets of MeCP2 has proven to
be difficult both because MeCP2 binds broadly across the entire
neuronal genome (4, 12, 17, 18), and because the changes in
gene expression that occur in the absence of MeCP2 are small
(11, 12, 17, 19–23). These unique challenges have made it difficult to identify which changes in gene expression in the absence
of MeCP2 are direct consequences of MeCP2 loss and which are
secondary effects of overall cellular dysfunction.
As a strategy for identifying the direct targets of MeCP2 action, we recently sought to identify common features of genes
that might distinguish whether or not a gene will be misregulated
as a direct consequence of the absence of MeCP2. These analyses revealed that at a genome-wide level, MeCP2 functions to
temper the expression of genes in a gene-length–associated
manner, possibly by binding to mCA sequences within the
transcribed region of these genes (12). Consistent with this idea,
the disruption of MeCP2 or Dnmt3a leads to up-regulation of
long genes that contain a high density of mCA. Notably, the
longer the gene the greater the extent of up-regulation that occurs in the absence of MeCP2 or Dnmt3a. Together with other
recent studies indicating that both gene length and non-CG
DNA methylation are associated with gene regulation by MeCP2
(11, 23), these findings suggest that MeCP2 acts at least in part as
a transcriptional repressor by functioning through brain-enriched
mCA to temper the expression of long genes in the brain.
Despite this recent progress in identifying putative direct targets
of MeCP2, several key gaps in knowledge remain. Whereas MeCP2
binding to mCA sequences appears to be critical to MeCP2-
dependent repression of gene transcription, this binding has not
been established unequivocally. Furthermore, whereas our initial
studies point to the binding of MeCP2 within genes as important for
transcriptional regulation, the sites of functionally relevant MeCP2
binding—for example, whether they are at enhancers, promoters,
and/or within the transcribed region of genes—remained to be
determined. In the present study, we examine the patterns of DNA
methylation across genes and provide evidence that the degree of
repression experienced by each gene is proportional to the total
number of MeCP2 binding sites within the transcribed region of the
gene. Taken together, these findings support a model in which
MeCP2 binds to methylated cytosines within gene bodies with high
affinity to temper gene expression, with the extent of gene repression by MeCP2 being related to the total number of MeCP2 molecules bound across a gene.
In addition to its role as a repressor of gene expression,
MeCP2 may function as an activator of transcription. Consistent
with this idea, many genes are down-regulated when MeCP2
function is perturbed and MeCP2 has been reported to interact
with the cAMP response element binding protein (CREB), a
neuronal stimulus-dependent activator of gene transcription
(19). Despite these findings, when we examined features of the
genes that are down-regulated when MeCP2 function is disrupted, such as their length, density of mCA and mCG, and the
extent of MeCP2 binding, these MeCP2-activated genes were
largely indistinguishable from similarly expressed genes whose
transcription is unaffected when MeCP2 is mutated. Taken together, these findings suggest that when bound to mCA, MeCP2
may function primarily as a repressor of gene expression.
Results
mCA and MeCP2 Binding Are Enriched in and Around MeCP2-Repressed
Genes. We have previously shown that genes whose expression is
up-regulated when MeCP2 function is disrupted are significantly
longer than the typical gene and contain a higher density of mCA
within their gene bodies than genes compared with the typical
gene in the genome (12). However, it is not known if the high
density of methylation of CA sites occurs specifically within the
transcribed regions of long genes or if this mark is laid down more
broadly across the genome. In the latter case, mCA would be
predicted to recruit MeCP2 throughout the broad domain of
mCA and could potentially repress the transcription of genes that
happen to reside within the mCA domain. At these sites, MeCP2
might function as a classical repressor that inhibits transcription by
binding to specific noncoding regulatory sequences or by compacting the DNA throughout broad genomic domains. Alternatively, binding of MeCP2 within the gene body might function
to retard the movement of the RNA polymerase II complex.
To begin to explore these possibilities, we examined the DNA
methylation (mCG and mCA) and MeCP2 binding profiles in and
around genes that have been consistently implicated as repressed
or activated by the presence of MeCP2 across multiple studies
(12), comparing these profiles to the average profiles for all other
genes in the genome. For this analysis, we calculated mCA or
mCG levels as the number of unconverted cytosines sequenced
during whole genome bisulfite sequencing analysis (8) within a
1-kb window of the genome divided by the total number of cytosine positions sequenced within that window; we then plotted the
average values for windows across gene loci (SI Experimental
Procedures). To assess MeCP2 binding we plotted the average
value of the MeCP2 ChIP divided by the input for 1-kb windows
across gene loci. Notably, this analysis revealed that genes that are
repressed by MeCP2 are enriched for mCA and MeCP2 binding,
not only within the body of the gene, but also as far away from the
transcribed region as several megabases 5′ of the transcriptional
start site (TSS) and 3′ of the transcriptional end site (TES) (Fig. 1).
This broad binding of MeCP2 is consistent with several distinct
models of MeCP2 function. MeCP2 might regulate chromatin
structure across the broad mCA domain, leading to silencing of
transcription within the entire domain. Alternatively, although
MeCP2 binds throughout the mCA domain, it could function selectively as a repressor at specific regulatory elements or within the
transcribed region to temper transcriptional elongation.
To further explore these possibilities, we analyzed the mCA
and mCG content across the length of broad mCA-enriched
domains that encompass genes to determine whether there is a
correlation between the degree of gene up-regulation in the
absence of MeCP2 and the presence of mCA sequences within
the 5′ flank, transcribed region, or 3′ flanking region of the gene.
By calculating the Spearman correlation for 1-kb bins of DNA
methylation in and around genes, we found that gene-body mCA
is most highly correlated with an up-regulation of gene expression in the absence of MeCP2 compared with the TSS, 5′ or 3′
flanking regions mCA (Fig. 1D). This suggests that the greater
the level of gene-body mCA across a gene, the greater the extent
of gene up-regulation that occurs in the absence of MeCP2,
highlighting an intimate link between gene-body mCA content
and the function of MeCP2 as a repressor that tempers gene
transcription within the transcribed regions of long genes.
As a further test of the idea that an enrichment of gene-body
mCA within genes is a reliable predictor that a given gene will be
repressed by MeCP2, we asked if the broad domain (400 kb)
encompassing short genes (<7 kb) was predictive of gene upregulation to a similar extent as gene-body mCA within long genes
(>100 kb). If the level of mCA in the region in or around a gene,
rather than gene-body methylation per se, determines the extent
of repression by MeCP2, one might predict that short genes embedded within a broad domain of high-density mCA would be upregulated in the absence of MeCP2. However, we find that short
genes within a large domain of high-density mCA are not significantly up-regulated when MeCP2 function is disrupted (Fig. S1).
This finding suggests that methylation of broad domains of CA
sequences around genes (i.e., within their 5′ and 3′ flanking regions) is not sufficient to impose regulation by MeCP2 on a gene;
rather, the methylation must occur within a broad region of the
gene itself for MeCP2 to exert an effect. Together, this analysis
suggests that whereas genes that are repressed by MeCP2 are
enriched for mCA within their 5′ flanking, transcribed, and 3′
flanking regions, the transcriptional repressive effects of MeCP2

are likely due to the binding of MeCP2 to methylated DNA within
the transcribed region of the gene.
Gene-Body mCA Is Critical for the Binding and Function of MeCP2. To
test directly the requirement of mCA for gene repression by
MeCP2, we used mice that lack mCA in the brain due to brainspecific conditional knockout (KO) of Dnmt3a (Nestin-Cre; Dnmt3a
flx/flx, referred to as Dnmt3a cKO mice), the de novo methyltransferase that catalyzes the addition of a methyl group to cytosines within CA sequences during early postnatal development
(12). To assess the influence of gene-body mCA on the distribution of MeCP2, we conducted MeCP2 ChIP sequencing (ChIPseq) from the cortex of Dnmt3a cKO and littermate control mice.
Whereas the amount of MeCP2 expressed in the cortex of
Dnmt3a cKO and control mice are similar (12), ChIP-seq analysis
reveals that in the Dnmt3a cKO cortex, MeCP2 is preferentially
depleted from genes that normally contain a high density of genebody mCA in control mice (Fig. 2). These findings suggest that
gene-body mCA is critical for the binding of MeCP2 within the
transcribed regions of genes. Consistent with this observation, we
have observed that long genes containing a high density of genebody mCA are up-regulated in Dnmt3a cKO mice (12), thus
phenocopying the misregulation of gene expression observed in
mice lacking MeCP2. We conclude that mCA within gene bodies
recruits MeCP2, which in turn functions to suppress the transcription of long genes. We note, however, that binding of MeCP2
across the genome was not completely abolished by disruption of
mCA in the brain (Fig. 2), suggesting that MeCP2 likely has mCGdependent as well as methylation-independent modes of binding
in addition to its interaction with mCA.
MeCP2-Mediated Gene Repression Is Proportional to the Total Number
of MeCP2 Binding Sites Within the Body of a Gene. Previously we have
observed that both gene-body mCA density and gene length are
correlated with gene repression by MeCP2, with long genes containing a high density of mCA showing the highest degree of
derepression in the MeCP2 KO (12). In addition, we observe a
correlation between fold change in gene expression in the MeCP2
KO compared with wild type (WT) and the density of MeCP2
ChIP signal within long genes (Fig. S2). These findings led us to

the number of nonconverted cytosines divided by the total number of cytosines sequenced in the CA or CG dinucleotide sequence context within 1-kb bins.
MeCP2 ChIP density was calculated as the log2 fold change of MeCP2 ChIP-seq coverage relative to input coverage from the reanalysis of data in ref. 11. In A–C,

(12). Data are plotted from 50 kb upstream to 75 kb downstream of the TSS and 50 kb downstream of the TES. In D, analysis was restricted to genes >75 kb to
allow for inclusion of the gene body; similar results with lower correlation values are observed when analyzing all genes.

consider the possibility that the total number of MeCP2 binding
sites across the body of a gene might best determine the extent of
repression exerted by MeCP2. In considering this possibility, we
included both mCA and mCG in the analysis, reasoning that even
though mCG density does not correlate with changes in gene
expression, it remains the case that mCG binds MeCP2 with high
affinity, and thus the number of mCG and mCA sequences within
a gene is likely the most accurate estimate of the number of
MeCP2 binding sites within a gene. Thus, we calculated the total
number of MeCP2 binding sites across the body of genes, summing the partial methylation frequency at each CG and CA and
examining the degree to which this value correlates with gene
repression relative to gene length or methylation density alone.
Consistent with previous findings, we observed that gene length
and gene-body mCA density, but not mCG density, are correlated
with the gene misregulation in MeCP2 KO mice (Spearman r: 0.12
for gene length, 0.12 for mCA density, and −0.007 for mCG density). However, the total number of mCA and mCG sites present
across the body of genes is slightly more correlated with gene
misregulation than either gene length or mCA density alone
(Spearman r: 0.14 for total mCA, 0.14 for total mCG, and 0.14 for
total mCA and mCG). Notably, the correlation between gene
misregulation and total MeCP2 binding sites was stronger for very
long genes (genes > 100 kb, Spearman r: 0. 28 for total mCA, 0. 25
for total mCG, and 0.27 for total mCA and mCG; genes > 400 kb,
Spearman r: 0.52 for total mCA, 0.53 for total mCG, and 0.56 for
total mCA and mCG), suggesting more robust detection of these
effects for genes with many mC sites. Visulization of the change in
gene expression in the MeCP2 KO compared with WT as a
function of the total number of mCA and mCG sites per gene
showed that the repression of genes by MeCP2 appears to be
continuous and proportional to the total number of mCA and
mCG sites within the gene, with no clear minimum threshold
number of sites required for the effect (Fig. 3A).
Given that gene length and the total number of mCG and mCA
sites across the body of a gene are highly correlated (Spearman r:
0.96), we next sought to determine whether the total number of
methylation sites is significantly correlated with the degree of gene
up-regulation in the absence of MeCP2 under conditions where
the correlation between gene length and gene misregulation is
excluded. By binning all genes in the genome by total mCA and
mCG counts per gene, we assessed the extent of length-dependent
gene up-regulation of a population of genes that fall within a restricted range of total mCA and mCG counts per gene. In this
way, a relationship between MeCP2-mediated gene repression
(i.e., genome-wide up-regulation) and gene length can be effectively
isolated away from an effect attributable to the total number of
sites per gene, despite the normally strong correlation between the
total number of mCA and mCG sites per gene and gene length.
This analysis failed to reveal an association between gene length
and the degree of gene up-regulation in the absence of MeCP2
when examining a set of genes that have a similar number of total
mCA and mCG sites within the body of genes (Fig. 3B). In contrast, examination of a population of genes in which the variation
in gene length was restricted revealed that the degree of gene upregulation correlated with the total number of mCA and mCG
sites across the body of a gene (Fig. 3C), suggesting that the total
number of mCA and mCG sites across the body of a gene best
predicts gene up-regulation in the absence of MeCP2. These results were robust to the particular set of genes that was selected, as
similar results were observed when analyzing gene populations
over a range of restricted-length windows or restricted total mCA
and mCG windows (Fig. S3). In addition, our findings were confirmed using partial correlation analysis, which demonstrated that

the total number of mCA and mCG marks across the body of a
gene contributes to the correlation with the degree of gene upregulation in the absence of MeCP2, even when gene length
is excluded as a parameter (Spearman r, controlling for gene
length = 0.12, P = 1.93 × 10−32). By contrast, if in this analysis we
control for the total number of mCA and CG sites within genes,
the positive correlation between gene length and the up-regulation
of gene expression in the absence of MeCP2 is no longer observed
(Spearman r, controlling for the total number of mCA and mCG
sites per gene = −0.07, P = 2.45 × 10−15). Taken together, these
analyses suggest that the total number of MeCP2 binding sites
within a gene is an important determinant of the extent of MeCP2-
mediated repression for that gene. Thus, whereas many shorter
genes likely experience little repression by MeCP2 because they
have an insufficient number of MeCP2 binding sites within their
transcribed regions, long genes with a high density of gene-body
mCA are likely the most repressed by MeCP2 because they contain the greatest number of total mCA and mCG marks per gene.
mCA Is Enriched in Genes That Are Repressed, but Not Activated by
MeCP2. Given that genes whose expression is increased when
MeCP2 function is disrupted contain high levels of gene-body
mCA and are significantly longer than the average gene length
(12), we considered the possibility that the group of genes that is
down-regulated in the absence of MeCP2 might also have a specific methylation and/or chromatin signature that defines this set
of genes and explains how the presence of MeCP2 in the cell
activates their expression. To address this possibility, we compared
the features (e.g., mCA and mCG content, histone acetylation,
gene length) of genes whose expression is down-regulated in the
absence of MeCP2 across studies of several brain regions with
those of genes whose expression does not change when MeCP2
function is disrupted in these studies. This analysis revealed that
with respect to mCA and mCG density, the extent of MeCP2
binding, the presence of histone acetylation marks and average
gene length these genes are largely indistinguishable. In particular,
DNA methylation analysis from the cortex (8), cerebellum (12), or
hippocampus (9) revealed that neither mCA nor mCG is enriched
in the promoters or gene bodies of genes whose expression is
consistently decreased in the absence of MeCP2 across multiple
studies of MeCP2 mutants (Fig. 4). Furthermore, lists of MeCP2-
activated genes identified by analysis of gene expression changes
for individual brain regions showed little enrichment for mCA or
mCG or gene bodies (Fig. 4).
Discussion
In this study, we explored determinants of MeCP2-mediated
gene regulation. Consistent with MeCP2 functioning through
gene-body DNA methylation, we find that mCA density and
MeCP2 occupancy within the transcribed region of a gene are
correlated with the up-regulation of gene expression in the absence of MeCP2. Furthermore, we find that the number of mCA
and mCG MeCP2 binding sites within the body of a gene is a
better predictor of the repressive effects of MeCP2 than the
density of mCA in the surrounding genomic territory in which a
gene resides. Thus, whereas the broad region around MeCP2-
repressed genes is enriched in mCA, the level of gene-body mCA
together with mCG appears to be a major determinant of transcriptional repression by MeCP2. In addition, DNA methylation
is not notably enriched at promoter regions of MeCP2-repressed
genes relative to expression-matched control genes (Fig. 4),
further supporting a role for gene-body–mediated repression by
MeCP2. These findings raise the possibility that MeCP2 represses
gene transcription by operating within genes rather than affecting
larger domains of chromatin or specific regulatory elements.
However, future studies exploring the nature of Dnmt3a-mediated
DNA methylation in maturing neurons will be critical to understand how high levels of DNA methylation accumulate in and
around MeCP2-repressed genes.
Recently, we demonstrated that loss of mCA or disruption of
MeCP2 function in the brain can lead to the up-regulation of
long genes that have a high-density of mCA within their transcribed region (12). In addition to this correlation with gene
repression by MeCP2, we show here that loss of mCA results in a
modest reduction in MeCP2 occupancy in genes, with the
greatest reduction in MeCP2 occurring in gene bodies that
normally contain a high density of mCA. These findings suggest
that the binding of MeCP2 to mCA sites contributes to MeCP2-
dependent transcriptional repression. However, we note that
mCA density is not the sole determinant of DNA binding or gene
repression by MeCP2, as the binding of MeCP2 to chromatin is
not completely disrupted by erasure of the mCA mark.
In this study, we present evidence that it is not the length of a
gene per se, or the density of mCA irrespective of gene length,
but rather it is the total number of MeCP2 molecules bound to
mCA and mCG sequences in the gene that predicts the extent of
gene silencing by MeCP2. In a recent study, we had examined
mCA density and gene length independently, observing that
genes that are below a minimum mCA density or a minimum
length do not show length-associated or mCA-associated derepression in the MeCP2 KO, respectively (12). Whereas these
findings suggested that there is a threshold mCA density and
gene length required in order for MeCP2 to repress genes,
reexamination of the gene sets analyzed in our previous study
indicates that the genes that are below the thresholds used
contain low levels of total mC (due to their short length or low
mCA density), and as a result, they would not be expected to be
measurably affected in the MeCP2 mutant. Thus, our previous
findings are consistent with a model in which the level of repression exerted on a gene by MeCP2 is proportional to the total
number of MeCP2 binding sites in the gene.
Whereas MeCP2 binds to mCA and mCG marks with high
affinity as assessed by in vitro and in vivo binding studies (9, 11,
12), it is notable that density of gene-body mCG does not appear
to be substantially enriched in MeCP2-repressed genes compared
with sets of genes whose expression is unaffected or decreased in
the absence of MeCP2 (Fig. 4). Compared with mCA, the density
of mCG within gene bodies does not vary substantially across
the genome. Thus, lack of gene-body mCG enrichment in MeCP2-
repressed genes may reflect the fact that CG dinucleotides are
generally highly methylated in the majority of gene bodies. We note
that this lack of increased mCG density within MeCP2-repressed

genes does not exclude the possibility that binding of MeCP2 to
mCG within these genes contributes to gene repression. Indeed, our
analysis showing that the total number of mC sites in genes predicts
gene repression by MeCP2 supports a role for both mCG and mCA
in this repressive mechanism (Fig. 3).
Whereas our study points to binding of MeCP2 in gene bodies
as an important site of gene regulation, the molecular mechanism
by which this process occurs remains to be defined. Our findings
are consistent with a model in which each MeCP2 molecule bound
within a gene contributes to a cumulative repressive effect on
transcription elongation. For example, MeCP2 molecules along
the gene body might recruit the NCoR corepressor complex,
thereby promoting a restrictive local chromatin structure that
impedes or blocks the progress of RNA polymerase II. If each
instance of this MeCP2 binding and repression along the gene
leads to a slight increase in the rate of aborted transcription during
the elongation phase of transcription for that gene, this would
result in the subtle down-regulation of genes containing many
MeCP2 binding sites that we observe. This model is consistent
with previous observations that interaction with NCoR is critical
for the function of MeCP2 (5), and our finding that the MeCP2
R306C missense mutation, which disrupts the MeCP2–NCoR interaction, leads to length-associated up-regulation of gene expression in mouse brain (12). Future studies examining precisely
how transcription of long genes is affected in the MeCP2 KO and
dissecting the role of NCoR in this process will allow us to test this
model for gene-body–mediated regulation by MeCP2.
The present study describes one mode of gene repression by
MeCP2, but other potential mechanisms of gene regulation mediated by this enigmatic protein likely remain to be uncovered. For
example, recent evidence suggests that MeCP2 recruits NCoR to
specific regulatory elements in the genome to deacetylate the FOXO
transcription factor and alter gene expression (24). The degree
to which this mechanism intersects with the gene-body–mediated
mechanism we describe here remains to be determined. In addition, a large number of genes are down-regulated when MeCP2
function is disrupted, raising the possibility that MeCP2 is directly
activating these genes. Our analyses failed to detect a robust enrichment in MeCP2 binding and/or mCA content when these
genes were compared with sets of genes whose expression is unaffected when MeCP2 function is disrupted. This raises the possibility that MeCP2 may not activate genes by a direct mode of
action that requires mCA. One of the hallmark features of
MeCP2-deficent mouse and human neurons is decreased dendritic
branching, soma, and nuclear size (25, 26). It has recently been
demonstrated that mammalian cells globally scale transcription in
a cell-volume–dependent manner to preserve transcript concentration (27). Genes down-regulated in the absence of MeCP2 may
reflect a global reduction in transcription in the context of reduced
cellular volume. Alternatively, genes may be targeted for gene
activation by MeCP2 by a yet-to-be-appreciated mechanism. Future studies will help to define the full complement of mechanisms
used by MeCP2 for its critical role in neuronal gene regulation.
Experimental Procedures
All animal experiments were performed using procedures approved by the
Harvard Medical Area Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee. Analyses of gene expression, DNA methylation, and ChIP-seq were performed
through reanalysis of published datasets and through generation of MeCP2
ChIP-seq data from the cortex of the Dnmt3a conditional KO mice. SI Experimental Procedures provides additional details.
