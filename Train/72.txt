We have characterized a light-input pathway regulating Drosophila
clock neuron excitability. The molecular clock drives rhythmic electrical excitability of clock neurons, and we show that the recently
discovered light-input factor Quasimodo (Qsm) regulates this variation, presumably via an Na+, K+, Cl− cotransporter (NKCC) and the
Shaw K+ channel (dKV3.1). Because of light-dependent degradation
of the clock protein Timeless (Tim), constant illumination (LL) leads
to a breakdown of molecular and behavioral rhythms. Both overexpression (OX) and knockdown (RNAi) of qsm, NKCC, or Shaw led to
robust LL rhythmicity. Whole-cell recordings of the large ventral
lateral neurons (l-LNv) showed that altering Qsm levels reduced
the daily variation in neuronal activity: qsmOX led to a constitutive
less active, night-like state, and qsmRNAi led to a more active, daylike state. Qsm also affected daily changes in K+ currents and the
GABA reversal potential, suggesting a role in modifying membrane
currents and GABA responses in a daily fashion, potentially modulating light arousal and input to the clock. When directly challenged
with blue light, wild-type l-LNvs responded with increased firing at
night and no net response during the day, whereas altering Qsm,
NKKC, or Shaw levels abolished these day/night differences. Finally,
coexpression of ShawOX and NKCCRNAi in a qsm mutant background
restored LL-induced behavioral arrhythmicity and wild-type neuronal activity patterns, suggesting that the three genes operate in the
same pathway. We propose that Qsm affects both daily and acute
light effects in l-LNvs probably acting on Shaw and NKCC.
circadian rhythms | light input | membrane excitability | GABA reversal

All organisms are subject to predictable but drastic daily environmental changes caused by the earth’s rotation around
the sun. It is critical for the fitness and well-being of an individual
to anticipate these changes, and this anticipation is done by circadian timekeeping systems (clocks). These regulate changes in behavior, physiology, and metabolism to ensure they occur at certain
times during the day, thereby adapting the organism to its environment (1). The circadian system consists of three elements: the
circadian clock to keep time, inputs that allow entrainment, and
outputs that influence physiology and behavior (2). Like a normal
clock, circadian clocks run at a steady pace (24 h) and can be reset.
In nature this environmental synchronization is done via daily light
and temperature cycles, food intake, and social interactions (3).
In Drosophila the central clock comprises 75 neuron pairs
grouped into identifiable clusters that subserve different circadian functions (Fig. 1A). The molecular basis of the circadian
clock is remarkably conserved from Drosophila to mammals (4).
This intracellular molecular clock drives clock neurons to express
circadian rhythms in electrical excitability, including variation in
membrane potential and spike firing. Clock neurons are depolarized and fire more during the day than at night, and circadian
changes in the expression of clock-controlled genes encoding
membrane proteins such as ion channels and transporters likely
contribute to these rhythms (5–8). Such cyclical variations in
activity play a critical role in synchronizing different clock neurons and conveying circadian signals to other parts of the nervous
system and body (9, 10). Furthermore, they provide positive feedback to the molecular clock, which can dampen rapidly without such
feedback (7, 11, 12).
Light resets the circadian clock every morning to synchronize
the clock to the environment via Timeless (Tim) degradation
after activation of the blue-light photoreceptor Cryptochrome
(Cry), Quasimodo (Qsm), and potentially also visual photoreceptors (13–17). Qsm acts either independently or downstream
of Cry and also is able to affect clock protein stability in Qsmnegative neurons by an unknown non–cell-autonomous mechanism
(16). Recently Cry has been shown to regulate clock neuron excitability via the redox sensor of the Hyperkinetic voltage-gated potassium (KV)-β subunit (Hk) (18, 19), and here we ask if Qsm
affects the clock neurons in a similar way.
Membrane potential is important for control of circadian behavior,
and manipulation of Shaw and the Narrow Abdomen (NA) channels,
both of which are expressed and function within clock neurons influence neuronal electrical activity, the circadian clock, and clockcontrolled behavior in both flies (20–22) and mice (23–25). The firing
rate is a key component in mammalian circadian rhythmicity and can
be regulated by regional and circadian expression of the sodium
potassium chloride cotransporter NKCC, which switches the effects
of GABA from inhibitory to excitatory across the day (26, 27).
Here we show that down-regulation or overexpression of the
three membrane proteins encoded by the genes qsm, Shaw, and
Significance
Most organisms developed a circadian clock to adapt their
behavior to daily changes of light and temperature. The molecular clock is remarkably conserved across species with much
of our current understanding coming from Drosophila studies.
To generate circadian behavior, appropriate levels of neuronal
electrical activity are crucial, but the regulators of this activity
have remained largely elusive. Here we identify three membrane proteins that interact to set the clock neurons to “day” or
“night,” forming a light-input pathway to the circadian clock.
The membrane-anchored extracellular protein Quasimodo affects both the daily changes in physiological properties and
light responses of brain clock neurons, possibly acting upstream of the potassium channel Shaw and the Na+, K+, Cl− ion
transporter NKCC.

NKCC leads to rhythmicity in constant illumination (LL) and that
these genes interact. All three genes are expressed in the wellcharacterized pigment-dispersing factor (Pdf)- and Cry-positive large
ventral lateral neurons (l-LNv) (21, 28), which are important for
arousal and light input to the clock (18, 19, 29–32). We used wholecell recordings of l-LNvs to characterize their physiological properties and acute light effects across the day and found that Qsm helps
set the circadian state of clock neurons and modifies their response
to light, possibly by acting via Shaw and NKCC.
Results
Rhythmic LL Behavior and the Interaction of Qsm with Shaw and
NKCC. Light resets the circadian clock, and consequently, wildtype flies displayed arrhythmic behavior in constant dim white
light (LL, 10 μW/cm2
), whereas cry02 loss-of-function mutants
were rhythmic (Fig. 1 B and C and Table S1) (15, 33). Previously
we have shown that Qsm triggers Tim degradation within clock
cells, and knockdown of qsm [qsmRNAi, i.e., >70% reduction of
qsm mRNA (16)] in all clock neurons using tim-gal4 resulted in
robust long-period (∼27-h) locomotor rhythms in LL (16). We
confirmed that qsmRNAi induces robust and long-period rhythms
in LL using two independent qsm-RNAi lines. Interestingly, qsm
overexpression (qsmOX) led to shorter, ∼13-h rhythms, most
likely reflecting the persistence of morning and evening activity
peaks in LL.
Because NKCC interacts physically with Qsm in yeast (34) and
because Shaw expression in clock neurons partially overlaps with
the expression of qsm (16, 21), we tested whether NKCC and
Shaw would also affect LL behavior. Changing levels of both
NKCC and Shaw resulted in flies that were rhythmic in dim LL.
Like qsmRNAi flies, flies overexpressing NKCC (NKCCOX flies)
exhibited long periods (∼29 h), whereas NKCC knockdown
[NKCCRNAi ; an ∼70% reduction of mRNA (Fig. S1)] and Shaw
knockdown [ShawRNAi ; an ∼90% reduction of Shaw (29)]
resulted in ∼13-h periods, reflecting potential bimodal behavior
similar to that of qsmOX. Shaw overexpression (ShawOX) induced
remarkably robust ultradian rhythms with an ∼4-h period, indicating compromised circadian clock function (21) and uncovering an underlying ultradian rhythm presumably generated by a
membrane-based oscillator. These manipulations did not affect
behavior in constant darkness (DD) (Table S2), with the exception of ShawOX, which led to arrhythmicity as previously
reported (21).
The light sensitivity of wild-type flies is also influenced by the
naturally occurring s-tim/ls-tim polymorphism (35, 36), and we
therefore performed experiments with both alleles. In all tested
cases (qsmOX, qsmRNAi, ShawRNAi, and NKCCOX), s-tim caused a
dramatic (∼50%) reduction in the percentage of rhythmic flies
compared with ls-tim flies and often was correlated with period
lengthening (Fig. S2 and Table S1). This result fits well with the
previous observation that flies carrying the s-tim allele are more
light sensitive than their ls-tim counterparts, and the dramatic
behavioral difference caused by the two alleles underscores their
biological importance (35, 36).
Because the tim-gal4 driver is also expressed in the photoreceptor cells of the compound eyes, we also tested flies with impaired visual system function. Similar to wild-type flies, flies
lacking (i) all external photoreceptors (gl60j) (15), or (ii) phospholipase C-β required for the visual phototransduction cascade
(norpAP41) (37), or (iii) histamine, the principal neurotransmitter
of the visual system (HdcJK910) (38), became virtually arrhythmic
during LL (Table S1). These results strongly suggest that the timgal4–mediated LL rhythmicity is induced by the alteration of qsm,
Shaw, and NKCC expression within the clock neuronal network.
To test directly for genetic interactions, we determined the
effects of altering Shaw and NKCC levels on the LL-rhythmic
phenotype induced by reducing Qsm. We used qsm105, an intragenic gal4 insertion line that reduces qsm expression, and induced ∼37% LL rhythmicity in heterozygous (qsm105 > +) flies
(Fig. 1 B and C and Table S1) (16). With the qsm105 driver, both
ShawOX and NKCCRNAi induced wild-type scores of LL rhythmicity
(i.e., 2%), whereas the opposite manipulation led to increased
rhythmicity scores (54% and 81%, respectively). The apparent genetic interaction among qsm, Shaw, and NKCC suggests that they
function in the same pathway. We propose that Qsm influences
membrane properties via ion channels (Shaw) and transporter
proteins (NKCC) that in turn might influence the molecular responses of circadian clock neurons to light.
Qsm Affects Daily Changes in Physiological Properties. To determine
how Qsm, Shaw, and NKCC might contribute to clock neuronal
activity, we examined their neurophysiological roles by performing whole-cell recordings from l-LNv with altered qsm,
Shaw, or NKCC expression using Pdf-gal4 and uas-RFP (Fig. S3
A and B). We focused on the l-LNv because they represent the
electrophysiologically best-characterized clock neuronal cell type
and because they express qsm, Shaw, and NKCC (8, 21, 28).

NEUROSCIENCE
Although physiological parameters showed variability among
recordings of different animals, wild-type l-LNvs showed a more
depolarized resting membrane potential (RMP) and a higher
spontaneous firing rate (SFR) in the day than at night (Fig. 2 A
and B and Table S3) (5, 31). In daytime recordings, qsmOX led to
a more hyperpolarized RMP and reduced SFR that were very
similar to control and qsmOX nighttime recordings. In contrast,
qsmRNAi depolarized the neurons and increased SFR at night to
levels similar to those in wild-type and qsmRNAi l-LNvs. We tested
two qsmRNAi lines targeting different regions of the qsm transcript
(16) and did not observe a difference between the two lines (pooled
data are shown). Interestingly, the differences in daytime and
nighttime RMP and SFR in wild-type l-LNvs were abolished in both
qsmOX and qsmRNAi l-LNvs. Resembling the changes seen for qsm,
ShawOX led to more hyperpolarized, less active neurons, and
ShawRNAi led to more depolarized and more actively firing neurons.
NKCC manipulations had the opposite effect, with NKCCOX
depolarizing and activating the neurons, in particular at nighttime,
and with NKCCRNAi hyperpolarizing and inactivating the neurons.
Qsm Affects Daily Changes in K+ Currents and the GABA Reversal
Potential, and Qsm Interacts with Shaw and NKCC. To elucidate
potential mechanisms by which Qsm could affect physiological
properties, we tested whether the effect might be caused by alterations in voltage-dependent somatic currents affecting the
RMP. We examined the current–voltage relationships of l-LNvs
and measured the non-inactivating currents that include Shaw
(Fig. 2 C and D and Table S4) (39, 40). We analyzed the sustained current densities of wild-type l-LNvs at daytime and
nighttime and could not detect any difference around the RMP,
most likely because of masking by the leak-current subtraction.
There was a difference, however, at positive holding potentials
(+100 mV), with current densities at night being >30 pA/pF
larger than in the day, suggesting more potassium channels were
open at night. ShawOX resulted in a high current density similar to
that recorded in wild-type l-LNvs at night, whereas ShawRNAi values
matched wild-type daytime recordings, indicating that Shaw is involved in the observed day/night difference. Mimicking Shaw,
qsmOX had high current densities similar to those in wild-type
l-LNvs at night, and qsmRNAi currents matched wild-type day levels.
This observation suggests that Qsm interacts with voltage-gated
potassium channels such as Shaw in setting membrane properties.
Manipulating NKCC levels had an effect on RMP and SFR,
and although NKCC activity is electrically neutral, NKCC pumps
chloride ions into the cell, increasing the intracellular chloride
concentration. We therefore tested whether the GABA reversal
potential (EGABA) of l-LNvs also changes across the day by
injecting GABA (10 ms, 25 mM, 10 psi) into the ipsilateral medulla.
In all cases spiking activity was affected. We measured the induced
currents and calculated EGABA from the resulting I–V curve (Fig. 2
E–H and Table S5). During the day the EGABA was more positive
(>10 mV), making GABA input less effective. GABA injections in
the daytime or nighttime increased the EGABA in NKCCOX brains
and had the opposite effect in NKCCRNAi brains in which the EGABA
was more negative, thereby mimicking the wild-type day/night
change. Changing Qsm levels also had an effect that again was in the
opposite direction of NKCC, with qsmOX decreasing and qsmRNAi
increasing the EGABA. Strikingly, in some cases the EGABA was more
positive than the RMP and GABA consequently acted as an excitatory neurotransmitter that induced firing (Fig. 2G, red arrow in the
top trace). These results suggest that Qsm interacts with NKCC and
that they participate in the daily change in GABA efficiency.
To characterize the interaction of Qsm with Shaw and NKCC
further, we tested whether altering levels of Shaw and NKCC
could rescue some of the qsm-induced physiological changes. We
used tim-gal4 > qsmRNAi to reduce Qsm expression in all clock
neurons and found an effect similar to that seen with Pdf-gal4.
Again we did not observe a difference between day and night,
but the resulting firing rate was much higher (Fig. 3 and Table
S3), suggesting additional network effects. We then coexpressed
qsmRNAi with ShawOX and NKCCRNAi and could rescue the

elevated firing rate to wild-type levels, mimicking the behavioral
rescue experiments and further supporting a cell-autonomous
interaction of Qsm with Shaw and NKCC. Interestingly, ShawOX
seems to be more effective than NKCCRNAi, and the rescue was
less pronounced at night.
In summary, overexpression and RNAi knockdown of qsm and
Shaw resulted in opposing phenotypes compared with NKCC
manipulations. Interestingly, qsmOX or ShawOX and NKCCRNAi
promote the less active nighttime state, whereas qsmRNAi, ShawRNAi
and NKCCOX push the neurons into the more depolarized daytime
state, eliminating the acute differences between daytime and
nighttime in all cases. Furthermore, Qsm interacts with Shaw and
NKCC to affect potassium currents and the EGABA.
Effects of Acute Light on l-LNvs and Its Modulation by Qsm. Altering
the levels of Qsm, Shaw, and NKCC led to LL rhythmicity, suggesting an impairment of the light input to the circadian clock.
Because the visual system mutants became arrhythmic, the alteration of Qsm, Shaw, and NKCC within clock neurons must be responsible for the observed LL rhythmicity. Although l-LNv neurons
are unlikely to be mediators of rhythmic behavior in LL (16, 41–43),
they are arousal neurons that are activated by blue light via Cry (18).
Therefore we tested the response of l-LNvs to light in isolated
brains, i.e., in the absence of all canonical photoreceptors including
the compound eye, the HB-eyelet, and the ocelli, leaving only deepbrain photosensitive pathways (e.g., Cry) intact.
At night all tested wild-type neurons responded to blue light
with a slight depolarization and an increase in firing rate, either
directly at lights-on (Fig. 4A) or after a brief startle response
(Fig. 4A, Bottom), often outlasting the stimulus by tens of seconds before eventually returning to the baseline firing rate. On
average, the spiking in response to blue light at night increased
by 1–2 Hz to levels near the resting firing rate in the daytime
(Fig. 5A and Table S3). In the daytime the response was different,
more complex, and variable. Some neurons briefly increased (n = 2)
or decreased firing (n = 5), but on average there was not much
change in firing frequency, a response clearly different from that
observed at night and suggesting daily variation in the responsiveness and light sensitivity of the clock. We occasionally (n =
8) observed a startle response with a brief period of either increased
firing or no firing immediately after the lights-on transition both at
day and night. Consistent with published data (18), the effect was
seen only with blue (470 nm) and not with green (555 nm) (Fig.
S3C) or red (625 nm) light. cry02 l-LNvs did not respond to blue
light (Fig. S3D) but had day/night changes in RMP and SFR similar
to those in control l-LNv, indicating that Cry is not required for the
regulation of neuronal electrical activity by the circadian clock.
qsmOX always led to neurons with diminished firing frequency in
response to the light pulse (Fig. 4B). Therefore, qsmOX l-LNvs behaved rather like cry02 neurons, the control neurons exposed to
green light, or the daytime wild-type neurons. qsmRNAi, in contrast,
always led to an increase in the spike rate in response to blue light
similar to that seen in wild-type night recordings but starting from a
higher baseline rate (Fig. 4C). The average change in firing was very
similar to the wild-type nighttime response and was independent of
the time of day (Fig. 5A and Table S3). Light pulses in the presence
of up- or down-regulation of Shaw resulted in changes similar to
those seen with the equivalent alterations of qsm expression, and
NKCC manipulations resulted in opposite changes (Fig. S3 E–H).
In summary, wild-type flies show a differential day/night response to
blue-light pulses, but no such difference was seen in flies with Qsm,
Shaw, and NKCC manipulations, the response of these flies being
determined instead by the respective up- or down-regulation of
gene expression.

excitability via the membrane proteins Qsm, Shaw, and NKCC.
Previously we have shown that Qsm contributes to circadian clock
light input with down-regulation in all clock neurons (tim-gal4)
resulting in robust rhythmic behavior in LL (16). Here we show
that overexpression (qsmOX) also results in robust LL rhythmicity,
but with predominantly ∼13-h periods, suggesting a more robust
morning oscillator that is normally weakened in DD conditions
(Fig. 1 and Table S1). Manipulating the expression levels of both
the potassium channel Shaw and the ion cotransporter NKCC also
resulted in LL rhythmicity, whereas several visual system mutants
behaved like wild-type flies and became arrhythmic. These experiments show that the membrane proteins encoded by qsm, Shaw,
and NKCC control rhythmic behavior in LL. Furthermore, the
rescue of wild-type behavior and neurophysiological properties by
reciprocal changes of Qsm and Shaw and by the simultaneous reduction of Qsm and NKCC suggests that Qsm interacts genetically
and perhaps directly with Shaw and NKCC.
Clock neurons are more depolarized and fire more during the
daytime, and circadian changes in the expression of clock-controlled genes such as ion channels and transporters are likely to
play a part (7, 8). Contributing to this rhythm is a sodium leak
current mediated by NA that recently has been shown to depolarize Drosophila clock neurons (22). Here we show that Shaw,
NKCC, and Qsm also contribute to daily electrical activity
rhythms: overexpression and RNAi knock-down of qsm and
Shaw compared with NKCC resulted in opposing phenotypes.
Interestingly, qsmOX or ShawOX and NKCCRNAi promote the less
active nighttime state, whereas qsmRNAi, ShawRNAi, and NKCCOX
push the neurons into the more depolarized daytime state, eliminating the acute day/night differences in all cases (Fig. 2 and
Table S3). We have shown previously that Shaw regulates circadian behavior (21) and that, in agreement with our current findings, Shaw regulates membrane potential and firing in Drosophila
motoneurons (29, 44). NKCC activity is electrically neutral but
increases the intracellular Cl− concentration so that the GABAA
receptor opens in response to GABA but, as a consequence, Cl−
presumably exits the cell down its electrochemical gradient, thereby
depolarizing the membrane potential so that GABA effectively
becomes an excitatory neurotransmitter (6, 12, 26, 29, 45). Our
data show that in Drosophila a similar mechanism occurs, which is
consistent with potential NKCC enrichment in l-LNv at dawn (28).
The mechanism setting the neuronal state to either daytime or
nighttime via Qsm, Shaw, and NKCC is likely to be predominantly
cell-autonomous, because all components have been shown to act
or to be expressed in the l-LNv (8, 21, 28). Although in an earlier
study (16) using qsm-gal4 lines we did not detect qsm expression in
the l-LNv, these lines may not report expression faithfully in all qsm
cells. Now, the finding that qsm RNA is enriched in the l-LNv (28),
combined with the strong effects of two qsm-RNAi lines on l-LNv
electrical properties presented in this study, indicates that qsm is
endogenously expressed in these neurons.
Our physiological studies are limited to the Pdf-expressing
l-LNv neurons. These neurons are unlikely candidates for driving
behavioral rhythms in LL (41–43), and we showed previously
that qsm knockdown in Pdf neurons (s-LNv and l-LNv) does not
result in robust LL rhythmicity (16). Therefore the effects of
light on the electrical properties of l-LNv reported here do not
necessarily explain the LL rhythmicity observed after manipulating qsm, Shaw, and NKCC in all clock neurons. However, the
electrophysiological results using tim-gal4 show that Qsm, Shaw,
and NKCC could fulfill similar functions in other clock neurons,
including those crucial for LL rhythmicity (e.g., LNd and DN1).
Additionally, or alternatively, the manipulated l-LNv could generate
signals interfering with normal network function, resulting in the
observed rhythmic LL behavior.
Although qsm is a clock-controlled gene (16, 28, 46), the acute
blue-light effects we observed are too fast to be mediated
by transcriptional changes. Therefore, we favor a more direct
membrane-localized mechanism in which rapid light-dependent
posttranslational changes of Qsm alter the activity of Shaw and
NKCC. Because (i) Cry is required for light-dependent Tim
degradation in l-LNv (15), (ii) changing the Qsm level has no
effect on Cry levels, and (iii) qsmOX triggers Tim degradation in
the absence of Cry (16), the most likely explanation for the results reported here is that, in addition to activating Hk, Cry acts
upstream of Qsm, which in turn regulates the activity of Shaw
and NKCC. We assume that Qsm is activated by light because a
light pulse at night rapidly increases protein levels (16). Qsm is
an extracellular zona-pellucida (ZP) membrane-anchored protein, and we hypothesize that after light exposure the extracellular ZP domain is cleaved at a conserved furin protease
cleavage site, a form of posttranslational processing typical for
ZP-domain proteins (47). It is also possible that Qsm signals to
Shaw and NKCC in both membrane-bound and cleaved forms.
For example, at night membrane-bound Qsm could block
NKCC, whereas light-induced cleavage could release this block,
and the freed extracellular part could inactivate Shaw (Fig. 5B). This
mechanism is reminiscent to the mechanism by which the GPI-anchored extracellular protein Sleepless increases Shaker (KV1 channel) activity for regulating Drosophila sleep (48).
How Qsm-induced changes in clock neuron activity influence
the molecular clock remains an open question. Recent work
shows that, in addition to the canonical degradation via Cry and
Jetlag (49), Tim is also degraded via a Cul-3– and neuronal
activity-dependent pathway in DD that has been implicated in
mediating phase delays in the circadian clock (50, 51). In contrast to this activity-dependent Cul-3 pathway, the light responses in the current study depend on Cry. We therefore favor a
model in which the combined functions of Qsm, Shaw, and
NKCC contribute to the canonical Cry- and Jetlag-dependent
Tim-degradation pathway.

(Pdf-gal4) to blue light as measured by the activity in the 30-s light on (Fon)

Data are shown as means; whiskers indicate SD. The number of recorded
neurons for each genotype is indicated. *P < 0.05, ***P < 0.001; one-way
ANOVA with Dunnett’s post hoc test (*) or t test (#
). (B) Model of l-LNv
cellular changes underlying the membrane potential and the firing differences between daytime and nighttime. Qsm receives light input from Cry
and affects Shaw and NKCC activity. Additionally, Cry activates Hk and Qsm,
and light-activated Cry degrades Tim. Because Qsm is also expressed in Crynegative clock neurons (16), it is likely that non–cell-autonomous mechanisms also activate this pathway (this possibility is indicated by the question
mark). How, and to which extend, Qsm, Shaw and NKCC influence TIM
stability is unclear (dashed line). In the daytime, Qsm is cleaved from the
membrane, activity of Shaw is low, the sodium leak channel NA is active, and
NKCC activity is high, resulting in a more positive RMP and higher spiking
rate. In the nighttime Qsm is membrane bound, and Shaw levels are high, but
there is less NA and NKCC, resulting in more negative RMP and less spiking.

In conclusion, we demonstrate that Qsm affects both daily and
acute light responses of l-LNvs, and therefore (Qsm) presumably
contributes to light-input to the Drosophila circadian clock. Qsm
possibly signals downstream of Cry and acts on Shaw and NKCC
to change clock neuronal activity in response to light.
Materials and Methods
Flies were obtained from fly stock centers or were generated using the
ΦC31 integrase system (52) and were raised under standard conditions.
The efficiency of RNAi knockdown was confirmed using quantitative
RT-PCR (RT-qPCR) and a standard RNeasy kit (Qiagen). Analysis of fly
activity was performed using the Drosophila Activity Monitor (DAM) System and either a MatLab tool-box (53) or ActogramJ (54). Electrophysiological recordings were performed as previously described (55). Prism
(GraphPad) was used for statistical tests. Detailed procedures can be found
in SI Materials and Methods.
