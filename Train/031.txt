Cochlear inner hair cells (IHCs) transmit acoustic information to spiral ganglion neurons through ribbon synapses. Here we have
used morphological and physiological techniques to ask whether synaptic mechanisms differ along the tonotopic axis and within
IHCs in the mouse cochlea. We show that the number of ribbon synapses per IHC peaks where the cochlea is most sensitive
to sound. Exocytosis, measured as membrane capacitance changes, scaled with synapse number when comparing apical and
midcochlear IHCs. Synapses were distributed in the subnuclear portion of IHCs. High-resolution imaging of IHC synapses
provided insights into presynaptic Ca21 channel clusters and Ca21 signals, synaptic ribbons and postsynaptic glutamate receptor
clusters and revealed subtle differences in their average properties along the tonotopic axis. However, we observed substantial
variability for presynaptic Ca21 signals, even within individual IHCs, providing a candidate presynaptic mechanism for the
divergent dynamics of spiral ganglion neuron spiking.

After processing by the mammalian ear’s exquisite micromechanics
and mechanoelectrical transduction, acoustic information is encoded
at the afferent synapses of IHCs with high temporal precision1,2.
Presynaptic active zones of IHCs contain a synaptic ribbon, a multiprotein structure that tethers synaptic vesicles3,4 and ensures a large
pool of readily releasable vesicles5–8. Stimulus–secretion coupling is
governed by CaV1.3 L-type Ca2+ channels9,10 that tightly control the
release of glutamate from nearby fusion-competent vesicles2,8,11 onto
postsynaptic AMPA receptors12,13 on the unbranched peripheral axon
of the bipolar spiral ganglion neuron (SGN)14. As a result, each SGN
receives input from only one IHC active zone, while each IHC drives
several SGNs.
Whether and how the number and properties of afferent synapses
of the cochlea are ‘tuned’ for optimal sound encoding remains an
important question (refs. 15,16, for example). The frequency
selectivity of SGNs is primarily determined by the location of the
innervated IHC on the cochlea’s tonotopic axis, providing a place
code for frequency (refs. 17,18, for example). In addition, studies
of small samples of synapses from distinct cochlear regions have
indicated that the innervation density varies along the length of
the cochlea19–21. Moreover, it has been shown that SGNs covering
a narrow frequency range differ markedly in spontaneous and
evoked firing rates, sound threshold and dynamic range (for
example, refs. 22,23) and that they collectively encode a large
range of sound pressures. It is generally believed, but not yet

directly proven, that each IHC makes contact with such physiologically diverse SGNs. If true, the heterogeneity of SGN dynamics
could be caused by pre- and postsynaptic mechanisms7,19,24,25.
Pioneering work on the cat cochlea suggested that lowspontaneous-rate SGNs preferentially contact active zones with
large or even multiple synaptic ribbons at the neural side of IHCs
(toward the modiolus), whereas high spontaneous rate SGNs are
driven by small, ‘simple’ synapses at the abneural IHC side (toward
the outer hair cells)24.
Here we have used patch-clamp, confocal imaging of IHC presynaptic Ca2+ signals; confocal, 4Pi26,27 and stimulated emission
depletion (STED)28 microscopy of immunolabeled synapses; and
electron microscopy to characterize the distribution of afferent
synapses as well as their structure and function at different tonotopic regions of the cochlea. Having investigated thousands of
synapses in hundreds of IHCs, we provide a continuous representation of synapse number per IHC along the entire mouse cochlea, and
we show that synapse density parallels the neuronal population audiogram. Using STED microscopy, we provide optical,
nanometer-scale measurements of individual clusters of presynaptic
Ca2+ channels and postsynaptic AMPA receptors. Whereas
average structural and functional synapse properties varied only
slightly along the cochlea’s tonotopic axis, we found considerable
heterogeneity of presynaptic Ca2+ signals among the synapses in
IHCs in a given region.

(as determined by auditory brainstem responses (ABR)) of two
wild-type laboratory strains (C57BL/6N, postnatal day (P) 30; and
NMRI, P15–P20). We approximated their collective synaptic cochleograms by a quadratic function (Fig. 1b) to describe synapse number
per IHC along the tonotopic axis (see Supplementary Table 1 online
for fit coefficients). In gerbils (P28), we counted only synaptic
ribbons because we were not able to stain postsynaptic glutamate
receptor clusters reliably (Fig. 1c; Supplementary Fig. 1 and Supplementary Table 1). The synaptic cochleograms were then related to
hearing thresholds as estimated by ABR recordings (Fig. 1b; mice
were thereafter used for immunohistochemistry) or compound
action potentials24 (Fig. 1c) using published place-frequency
maps18,29. For both species, the synaptic cochleograms peaked within

RESULTS
Tonotopic synapse density map and subcellular distribution
First, we assessed the number of ribbon synapses per IHC throughout
the entire cochlea (creating a synaptic cochleogram) of mice (Fig. 1a,b;
high-frequency hearing) and gerbils (Fig. 1c and Supplementary Fig. 1
online; low-frequency hearing) by confocal microscopy of immunolabeled, whole-mount organs of Corti. The microdissected parts of the
organ of Corti were aligned for measuring the distance of a given
synapse to the apex of the cochlea (see Methods; Fig. 1a). We identified
IHC ribbon synapses as colocalized spots of presynaptic ribbons (using
antibody to transcription factor CtBP2 sharing homologous domain
with RIBEYE, the main protein component of the synaptic ribbon)
and postsynaptic GluR2/3 (labeling the AMPA receptor clusters)

Next, we studied the synapse distribution within apical (distance to
cochlear apex 200 ± 100 mm, n ¼ 2 mice; Supplementary Fig. 2 online)
and midcochlear (1,700 ± 400 mm, n ¼ 4 mice; Fig. 2) IHCs. Stacks of
confocal images obtained from organs of Corti immunolabeled for
CtBP2/RIBEYE and calbindin-28k, a Ca2+-binding protein marking
the IHC cytosol, were aligned according to the tonotopic axis (indicated by the row of IHCs) to identify synaptic ribbons and IHC nuclei
(see Methods). Synapses were assigned to IHCs based on their distance
to the center of the nearest IHC’s nucleus. Data were discarded if
assignments were ambiguous. The position of each synapse was
expressed in cylindrical coordinates (z-axial position, with z ¼ 0 at
the center of the nucleus; radius r and angle y as illustrated in Fig. 2a)
after normalizing the distance between the center of the nucleus and the
basal end of each IHC to the respective mean value of all analyzed IHCs.
We observed a strong base-to-apex decline in synapse abundance
from the base of the IHC to its apex and a rather uniform distribution

all four sides of six overlaid midcochlear
IHCs (Fig. 2b). We further described the
synapse distribution as functions of z-position
(Fig. 2c) and angle y (Figs. 2d,e). The
distribution of the three-dimensional nearest
neighbor distance had a mean of B2 mm and did not show obvious
higher-order peaks (Fig. 2f, estimated before normalization of cell
dimensions). The synapse distribution was similar for IHCs in the apex
of the cochlea, except for a tendency of synapses to accumulate in the
apical and basal IHC sectors (Supplementary Fig. 2).
Synapse morphology as a function of tonotopic position
The size of the synaptic ribbon largely determines the vesicle complement of each synapse (reviewed in ref. 3) and was previously used to
approximate the area of the active zone over which Ca2+ channels are
distributed30,31. The size of postsynaptic AMPA receptor clusters is a
key determinant of synaptic strength (for example, refs. 32,33). Thus,
we explored IHC synapse morphology in apical and midcochlear
regions using high-resolution fluorescence microscopy of immunolabeled IHC synapses, as well as electron microscopy.
Electron microscopy was performed on ultrathin sections of first
apical turns of cochleae. First, we compared the synaptic ultrastructure

ple, for the perception of wriggling calls of
mouse pups46. Each SGN conveys information
transmitted by one hair cell synapse to several neurons of the cochlear
nucleus, which in turn integrate information from several SGNs. The
reliability and acuity of afferent information provided by a region of the
cochlea will increase with the number of innervating SGNs.
Here we took advantage of the tonotopic gradient of synapse number
but uniform average presynaptic morphology in the mouse cochlea to
ask whether whole-cell Ca2+ current and exocytic DCm scaled with the
number of ribbon synapses, as would be expected if both occurred
exclusively at the synapse. This was indeed found to be the case for
exocytosis, as previously described for turtle hair cells37. Although we
cannot exclude some contribution of vesicles fusing outside the active
zone to exocytosis seen during prolonged stimulation3,47, we suppose
that much of this sustained release occurs at the synapse. This view is
supported by paired pre- and postsynaptic recordings from rat IHC
synapses8. These data revealed AMPA receptor current integrals that
were compatible with the notion of sustained exocytosis—as reported
by capacitance measurements—reflecting synaptic release.
Our STED data suggest that, at the IHC synapse, AMPA receptors
have a peripheral, ‘ring-like’ density maximum, which correlates with
electron microscopy data on the rat cochlea12. The observed receptor
distribution seems well suited for the efficient detection of glutamate
release, in particular if this release occurs preferentially at the circumference of the ribbon35. It deviates from the uniform receptor distribution of glutamatergic CNS synapses suggested by immunoelectron
microscopy (ref. 12; see review in ref. 48).
The Ca2+ current integral was not significantly different between
apical and midcochlear IHCs. In part, this can be attributed to the
stronger Ca2+ current inactivation in IHCs in the higher frequency
region, which is consistent with findings in the gerbil49. Still, even
the initial Ca2+ current was somewhat less correlated to synapse
number than exocytosis. Similar findings were obtained in the turtle
cochlea, where low-frequency synapses were assumed to mediate
larger Ca2+ influx37. Unlike that study, we conclude, based on
analysis of Ca2+ current, synaptic Ca2+ signals and Ca2+ channel
cluster size that, except for inactivation, Ca2+signaling of the
average mouse IHC synapse is structurally and functionally similar

suggested in the cat24. We used confocal Ca2+ imaging and STED
microscopy of immunolabeled ribbons in the neural and abneural 601
sectors to test for potential functional and morphological differences of
the respective synapses. Abneural synapses on average showed a smaller
fluorescence increment (Fig. 6e; DF/F0 neural/abneural ratio, 1.6). The
distributions of short (Fig. 6f) and long axes of ribbons (Fig. 6g) were
indistinguishable, suggesting that the average ribbon size did not differ
among neural and abneural synapses in mouse IHCs.
DISCUSSION
Our findings demonstrated that tonotopic variations in the sensitivity
of the mammalian cochlea are paralleled by the density of its afferent
innervation. We present nanoscale estimates of the size of ribbons, Ca2+
channel and AMPA receptor clusters at the IHC synapse for two
different tonotopic regions. Although substantially changing in number, IHC synapses in these cochlear regions differ only slightly in
structure. Exocytosis of IHCs scaled with the number of synapses,
which, together with the comparable average properties of presynaptic
Ca2+ signals, suggests a fairly uniform average synapse function in these
two regions and also, presumably, further along the cochlea’s tonotopic
axis. However, Ca2+ signals showed substantial heterogeneity among
synapses of an individual IHC, providing a potential presynaptic
substrate for the divergent spiking properties of the SGNs that are
driven by a given IHC.
Quantitative light microscopy of whole-mounted organs of Corti
allowed assembly of continuous synaptic cochleograms for mouse
(high-frequency hearing) and gerbil (low-frequency hearing) with a
sample size and frequency resolution exceeding those of previous
electron microscopy studies17,20,21,43. Synaptic cochleograms were
well described by quadratic functions, providing a simple and useful
tool for future studies on cochlear neurotransmission. The shape of the
mouse synaptic cochleogram roughly followed that of the mouse
behavioral audiogram44, that of the neural population audiogram
(for example, Fig. 1) and that of the distortion product otoacoustic
emission audiogram (for example, ref. 45). We interpret these findings
as better neural sampling from the most sensitive cochlear regions. In

ARTICLES
in the two frequency regions. The existence of extrasynaptic Ca2+
channels, as suggested by single channel recordings from bullfrog
hair cells39, is likely to explain the small remaining mismatch
between the scaling of number of Ca2+ channels (1.34) and number
of synapses (1.44).
Using various approaches, we compared, at two different frequency
regions, key morphological determinants of IHC synaptic transmission, including synaptic ribbons and vesicle complement, synaptic Ca2+
channel clusters and postsynaptic density. We found only subtle
differences (Fig. 3, Table 1), all indicative of slightly larger IHC
synapses in the apex of the cochlea. Testing the functional relevance
of these tonotopic differences requires more sensitive detection, such as
in paired pre- and postsynaptic recordings8.
However, we found considerable variability for all of the investigated
morphological and functional synapse parameters (Fig. 3, Tables 1 and
2, Supplementary Table 3 and Supplementary Fig. 4 and 5). Although
this limits detection of small systematic changes along the tonotopic
axis, it probably relates to the important question in auditory research
of the mechanisms behind the different functional properties of SGNs.
Pioneering work primarily in the cat cochlea has identified morphological correlates for high and low spontaneous firing rate SGNs (for
example, active zone morphology, abneural versus neural insertion;
diameter and mitochondrial content of the peripheral axon)14,22,24,43.
In the present study, we observed slightly lower synaptic Ca2+ signals in
the abneural sector of IHCs and found ribbon sizes to be comparable
for neural and abneural synapses. These findings seem hard to reconcile
with a systematically higher activity of abneural synapses in mouse
IHCs, for which one might have expected larger ribbons providing
more releasable vesicles3 and more Ca2+ channels.
Nevertheless, our experiments revealed substantial heterogeneity
between Ca2+ signals at active zones within individual IHCs (Fig. 6b
and Supplementary Table 3). Furthermore, we found a large variation
of CaV1.3 channel cluster size (CV ¼ 0.3), and, assuming a constant
channel density in the cluster, we propose that differences in channel
number contribute to this heterogeneity. Placement of synapses with
different properties seems rather random in mouse IHC. Future studies
combining imaging of synaptic Ca2+ signals with readouts of transmitter release and/or postsynaptic response7,8 will test how this
translates into differences of transmitter release among the synapses
of an individual mouse IHC.
METHODS
Animals. C57BL/6 and NMRI (Naval Medical Research Institute) mice aged
2–4 weeks and 4-week-old gerbils were used for experiments. Animal experiments complied with national animal care guidelines and were approved by the
University of Göttingen Board for animal welfare and the animal welfare office
of the state of Lower Saxony.
Auditory brainstem responses. See Supplementary Methods.
Patch-clamp and confocal Ca2+ imaging. IHCs from apical coils of freshly
dissected organs of Corti from NMRI and C57BL/6 mice (P14–18) were patchclamped as described5. The pipette solution for perforated-patch recordings
contained (in mM) 140 cesium gluconate, 13 tetraethylammonium (TEA)-Cl,
10 CsOH-HEPES buffer, 1 MgCl2, and 250 mg/ml amphotericin B, pH 7.2. The
pipette solution for whole cell recordings contained (in mM) 135 cesium
glutamate, 13 TEA-Cl, 20 CsOH-HEPES, 1 MgCl2, 2 Mg-ATP, 0.3 Na-GTP,
2 EGTA (10 for biophysical analysis of Ca2+ currents), 0.4 Fluo-5N (penta-K+

Patchmaster software (HEKA Elektronik) were used for measurements. All
voltages were corrected for liquid-junction potentials. Currents were low-pass
filtered at 14 kHz and 2 kHz and sampled at 100 kHz and 10 kHz for whole-cell
recordings and perforated-patch recordings, respectively. Cells that showed a
holding current exceeding 50 pA were discarded from analysis. Ca2+ currents
were further isolated using a P/n protocol. Series resistance was required to be
below 30 MO for perforated-patch experiments and averaged 10.0 ± 0.5 MO
(n ¼ 59) in the fluctuation analysis experiments. Fluctuation analysis was
performed similarly to that previously described11. To account for channel
gating-related and filter-induced correlations between neighboring currentvariance data points, we fitted the variance-over-mean data by an estimated
generalized least-squares method (Supplementary Table 2). The first 600 ms of
the tail current routinely were discarded. To avoid errors introduced by
remaining, uncancelled capacitive transients, we subtracted a scaled version
of the transient that was evident at the beginning of the depolarization step (see
Fig. 4e) from the mean current trace (after calculation of the ensemble
variance). Membrane capacitance increments (DCm) were measured
as previously described5. Interstimulus periods were 2–3 s between sweeps,
1–2 min between ensembles for confocal imaging, and 30–70 s for
exocytosis measurements.
Confocal Ca2+ imaging was performed as described40, using a Fluoview 300
confocal scanner mounted on an upright microscope (BX50WI) equipped with
a 0.9 numerical aperture (NA), 60, water immersion objective (all Olympus)
and a 50-mW, 488-nm, solid-state laser (Cyan, Newport-Spectraphysics).
Fluorescent hotspots were identified in xy-scans during 200-ms depolarizations
(0.5% of maximum laser intensity) and further characterized using spot
detection (‘point scan’ mode of the confocal scanner, temporally averaged to
yield an effective sampling rate of 1.85 kHz, 0.05% of maximum laser intensity)
and line scans (at a rate of 0.74 kHz, 0.25% of maximum laser intensity). Spot
detection measurements and line scans were repeated 5 and 10 times,
respectively, to improve signal-to-noise ratio. Peak DF estimates of spot
detection measurements were obtained after repetitive boxcar smoothing
(2-ms box). On average, we characterized 3.1 and 1.7 spots per IHC for
apical-basal and neural-abneural comparisons, respectively. The average Ca2+
current rundown at the end of the experiment was 30% of the maximum
current. For investigating intracellular differences, Ca2+ microdomain characterization was followed by acquisition of a z-stack of the indicator-filled cell so
that its location could be retrieved.
Immunohistochemistry. Immunostaining was performed as previously
described6. Briefly, the freshly dissected apical cochlear turns were fixed with
4% paraformaldehyde for 1 h on ice, with 2% formaldehyde for 10 min at
20–22 1C (for staining with antibody to GluR2/3 (anti-GluR2/3)), or for
25 min in 99% methanol at –20 1C (for anti-CaV1.3). For harvesting the fulllength organs of Corti, cochleae were fixed by cochlear perfusion with 2%
formaldehyde for 10 min. The following antibodies were used: mouse IgG1
anti-CtBP2 (also recognizing the ribbon protein RIBEYE; BD Biosciences,
1:150), rabbit anti-GluR2/3 (Chemicon, 1:200), rabbit anti-calbindin (Swant,
1:400), rabbit anti-CaV1.3 (Alomone Labs, 1:75) and secondary Alexa Fluor
488– and Alexa Fluor 568–labeled antibodies (Molecular Probes, 1:200) as well
as Atto-647N (AttoTech, 1:60 dilution in PBS with addition of 2% normal goat
serum) for STED microscopy. In some experiments, nuclei were stained with
Hoechst 34580 (Molecular Probes, 1:1,000).
Confocal, 4Pi and STED microscopy. Confocal morphological images were
acquired using a laser scanning confocal microscope (Leica TCS SP5, Leica
Microsystems) with 405-nm (diode), 488-nm (argon) and 561-nm (diodepumped solid state) lasers for excitation and a 63 oil immersion objective
(NA ¼ 1.4). Whole-mount preparations of the organ of Corti allowed us to
analyze several IHCs in a row, as previously described6. For three-dimensional
reconstructions of the specimen, z-axis stacks of two-dimensional images were
taken with a step size of 0.049 mm, 0.2 mm or 0.3 mm. Multifocal 4Pi
microscopy with water immersion lenses (NA 1.2) at a two-photon excitation
wavelength of 870 nm (average power, 1.5 mW for each of the 4Pi foci) was
performed at a custom microscope as described6,26,27. For STED imaging,
two different microscopes were used: (i) a Leica TCS STED microscope
(Fig. 3d–g) using two pulsed lasers for excitation (diode laser, 635 nm,

o90 ps) and stimulated emission (Ti:sapphire, 750 nm, B300 ps), with both
lasers running at a repetition rate of 80 MHz and synchronized to each
other to ensure optimal STED efficiency in the focal plane; and (ii) a custom
microscope50 (Fig. 3h–j). This microscope used identical lasers but allowed for
higher STED powers and therefore exhibited a resolution of B50 nm and
B150 nm for two-dimensional (x,y) and three-dimensional (x,y,z) imaging,
respectively. Single confocal and STED images of ribbons and Ca2+ channel
clusters were acquired after adjusting the focus of the 100 oil immersion lens
(NA ¼ 0.7 or 1.4) to the fluorescence maximum of an object of interest, as
found in a xz-scan.

Data analysis. Data was analyzed using Matlab (MathWorks), Igor Pro
(Wavemetrics) and ImageJ software. Figures were assembled for display in
Adobe Photoshop and Illustrator software. Mean DCm and Ca2+ current
estimates are grand means calculated from the mean estimates of individual
IHCs. Means were expressed ± s.d. (or s.e.m. when noted). If applicable (that is,
as determined by normality of the distribution (Jarque-Bera test) and equal
variances between (F-test) the two samples), an unpaired, two-tailed t-test was
used to compare the two samples. In all other cases, a Mann-WhitneyWilcoxon test was used.
Image analysis. For synaptic cochleograms, CtBP2/RIBEYE immunofluorescence spots in the basolateral portion of IHCs (up to the apical end of the
CtBP2-stained nucleus) were counted in z-stacks and divided by the number of
IHCs (taken as the quantity of nuclei in the field of view). Estimation of the
cellular synapse distribution was performed using custom-written MATLAB
routines (available at http://www.innerearlab.uni-goettingen.de/) that included
(i) alignment of the image stacks with the tonotopic axis, (ii) image segmentation into ribbons (positive, if more than four connected voxels were above
threshold) and nuclei, (iii) center of mass calculation for both types of
structures (by a three-dimensional gaussian fit in the case of nuclei), (iv)
assignment of ribbons to the closest IHC nucleus, (v) alignment of the
individual IHC’s z-axis to a common z-axis, (vi) normalization of the cell’s
z-extent (measured from the center of the nucleus to the basal end of the IHC)
to the population average and (vii) vector calculation. For Figure 2b, we also
normalized the radial extent of the IHCs for improved superposition.
The FWHM in confocal and STED images was estimated using gaussian
functions (two-dimensional for morphology, one-dimensional for functional
imaging). The two-dimensional data in Figure 3j was linearly deconvolved with
a two-dimensional gaussian PSF (FWHM of 70 nm for the STED and 250 nm
for the confocal).
