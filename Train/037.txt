Decreased plasma glucose concentration elicits a complex neuroendocrine response that prevents or rapidly corrects hypoglycemia
as required to preserve brain function1–4; however, where and how
low glucose is sensed is unknown4–6. Here we show that low glucose increases secretion from glomus cells in the carotid bodies,
sensory organs whose stimulation by hypoxia produces sympathetic
activation, by a process that depends on extracellular Ca2+ influx
and is paralleled by inhibition of voltage-gated K+ channels. We
propose a new glucose-sensing role for the carotid body glomus
cell that serves to integrate information about blood glucose and
O2 levels and to activate counterregulatory responses.
The carotid body is composed of innervated clusters of glomus
cells that, when activated by reduced O2 tension, release dopamine
and other transmitters to stimulate afferent sensory fibers7–9. Using
a new thin-slice preparation that retains the structure of the carotid
body and preserves the characteristic response of glomus cells to
hypoxia10, we examined the effect of decreased extracellular glucose. Exposure of glomus cells in these slices to a glucose-free (0 mM
glucose) solution induced a secretory activity as monitored by
amperometry9,10 (Fig. 1a). The average rate of secretion during the
last minute of exposure to low glucose, calculated from cumulative
secretion traces (Fig. 1a), was over 20 times that in the control condition of 5 mM glucose (Fig. 1b). The size distribution and mean
area of quantal events triggered by low glucose (Fig. 1c) were similar to those previously observed in glomus cells activated by hypoxia10, suggesting that the two conditions (glucopenia and hypoxia)
induced the release of a common vesicle pool. The effect of low glucose on glomus cells was concentration dependent. At normal air O2
tension (PO2 = 150 mmHg), control cells showed almost no secretory activity. When glucose was lowered to 2 mM, catecholamine
release increased in proportion to the glucopenia (Fig. 1d and e).
At air PO2, glomus cells are inhibited as a result of suppression of the O2-sensitive activation pathway9. The typical response
to hypoxia (PO2 ≈ 25 mmHg) of glomus cells in the slices10 was
markedly enhanced in 0 mM glucose (Fig. 2a), and the mean
secretory rate of cells exposed to hypoxia and glucose-free solutions was two- to threefold greater than to either stimulus separately (Fig. 2b). We therefore studied the sensitivity to glucose
of glomus cells maintained at 12% O2 (≈90 mmHg), an O2 tension comparable to that in the arterial blood irrigating the rat
carotid body in vivo. At this PO2, 5 mM glucose induced catecholamine release, and this activity was reversibly reduced on
exposure to higher (10 mM) glucose concentration (Fig. 2c).
The dependence of glomus cell secretion on glucose concentration at PO2 of 90 mmHg was displaced toward glucose levels
higher than those that triggered secretion at normal air O2 tension (Fig. 2d and e). Therefore, at the PO2 level of arterial blood,
glomus cell secretory activity is modulated by glucose in a physiological concentration range.

Catecholamine secretion elicited by glucose-free solutions was
abolished by blockade of voltage-gated Ca2+ channels with 0.2 mM
cadmium7–10 (n = 3; Fig. 3a), suggesting that this response depends
on depolarization-evoked Ca2+ influx. Modulation of glomus cell
secretion by low glucose was maintained in slices treated with
glibenclamide (5 µM), a blocker of ATP-regulated K+ (KATP) channels. In addition, input resistance measured in patch-clamped cells
held at –80 mV (286 ± 11 MΩ, mean ± s.d., n = 9), although relatively low (perhaps due to the high temperature or to electrical
coupling), was not altered by removal of glucose (267 ± 11 MΩ,
n = 9). These data suggested that leakage and KATP channels were
not appreciably influenced by the changes in glucose concentration. In contrast, glucose deficiency produced a reversible reduction
of outward K+ current amplitude in the entire range of membrane
potentials (Fig. 3b and c). At +20 mV, exposure to 0 mM glucose
decreased peak outward current amplitude by 38 ± 12% (mean ±
s.d., n = 7). These effects of low glucose were independent of
changes in intracellular ATP concentration, because in most
experiments cells were dialyzed with an internal solution containing 4 mM MgATP. In addition, low glucose–induced glomus
cell secretion was not prevented by 10 mM sodium pyruvate (n =
3; data not shown), a condition that supports the intracellular production of ATP. Low glucose regulated voltage-dependent K+ channels selectively, as it had no effect on the small inward current
characteristic of rat glomus cells (Fig. 3d). In addition, inhibition
of the K+ current by low glucose was maintained after blockade of
the Ca2+-activated maxi-K+ channels with iberiotoxin (Fig. 3e).
Our findings strongly suggest that carotid body glomus cells
are physiological glucose detectors that transduce glucose levels
into variable rates of transmitter release, which stimulate afferent
sensory fibers to evoke sympathoadrenal activation. Blockers of

with either 5% CO2 and 95% N2 (hypoxia, PO2 in the chamber ≈25 mmHg) or 5% CO2, 12 % O2 and 83% N2 (PO2 in the chamber ≈90 mmHg).
Equilibration of solutions in the chamber, as determined with an O2 electrode, required <30 s. The pH of all solutions was 7.4, osmolality ≈300 mOsm/kg
and temperature 35–37°C. Curves/lines in 2d, e were fitted by eye.

voltage-dependent K+ channels evoke depolarization8,11 and catecholamine secretion10 in these cells; it therefore is likely that, like the
hypoxia transduction cascade8–10, low-glucose signaling is initiated by inhibition of K+ channel activity, which facilitates membrane
depolarization, Ca2+ influx through voltage-gated Ca2+ channels
and transmitter release. These observations help to explain reports
that anesthetized animals show a rapid increase in the output of
hepatic glucose after infusion of the carotid body region with
NaCN5,12, alterations of carbohydrate metabolism in acute hypoxia13, or impairment of insulin-induced counterregulatory response
to mild hypoglycemia in dogs after resection of the carotid body
and surrounding tissues6. Although peripheral glucose control
might also be accomplished at the liver or portal vein4,14,15, the
strategically located carotid bodies are of special importance for
brain homeostasis, as neurons are particularly vulnerable to the
simultaneous lack of glucose and oxygen1,2. The function of glomus
cells as combined O2 and glucose sensors is surely advantageous
in facilitating activation of the counterregulatory measures in
response to small reductions of either variable.
