Although action potentials propagate along axons in an all-or-none
manner, subthreshold membrane potential fluctuations at the soma
affect neurotransmitter release from synaptic boutons. An important
mechanism underlying analog–digital modulation is depolarizationmediated inactivation of presynaptic Kv1-family potassium channels,
leading to action potential broadening and increased calcium influx.
Previous studies have relied heavily on recordings from blebs formed
after axon transection, which may exaggerate the passive propagation of somatic depolarization. We recorded instead from small
boutons supplied by intact axons identified with scanning ion
conductance microscopy in primary hippocampal cultures and asked
how distinct potassium channels interact in determining the basal
spike width and its modulation by subthreshold somatic depolarization. Pharmacological or genetic deletion of Kv1.1 broadened presynaptic spikes without preventing further prolongation by brief
depolarizing somatic prepulses. A heterozygous mouse model of
episodic ataxia type 1 harboring a dominant Kv1.1 mutation had a
similar broadening effect on basal spike shape as deletion of Kv1.1;
however, spike modulation by somatic prepulses was abolished.
These results argue that the Kv1.1 subunit is not necessary for subthreshold modulation of spike width. However, a disease-associated
mutant subunit prevents the interplay of analog and digital transmission, possibly by disrupting the normal stoichiometry of presynaptic potassium channels.

Although action potentials are generated at the axon initial
segment in an all-or-none manner, synaptic transmission can
be modulated by electrotonic propagation of subthreshold membrane depolarization from the soma (1–6). Inactivation of axonal
Kv1-family channels contributes to “analog” signaling by broadening presynaptic action potentials (6–9). Investigations of presynaptic
spike shape in small presynaptic boutons have relied heavily on
extrapolation from recordings in blebs that form after axons have
been transected (2, 6, 8, 9). A potential pitfall of this method is that
the ion channels present in blebs may not be representative of the
normal complement of channels at an unperturbed bouton. A
further difficulty is that the attenuation of voltage with distance
from the soma is likely to be smaller than when recording from an
intact axon. Indeed, classical cable theory predicts that steady-state
somatic voltage should decrease by ∼63% at one length constant if
the axon is represented by an infinite cable, but only by ∼35% if it is
sealed at the same point (10). The discrepancy increases as the axon
is made shorter: if the axon is cut at half a length constant, the
attenuation of steady-state voltage at its termination is only ∼29%
of that predicted for an infinite cable. Given that the length constant of unmyelinated axons in the CNS has been estimated in the
range of 400–600 μm (1–3, 9, 11), this implies that the modulation
of action potential shape by passively propagating subthreshold
somatic depolarization may have been greatly overestimated.
Recordings from large mossy fiber boutons avoid the pitfalls of
recording from axon blebs. However, although presynaptic depolarization broadened spikes and action-potential–evoked Ca2+
transients in one study (12), this was not detected in other studies
that examined subthreshold depolarization propagating from the
soma (1, 3). Presynaptic recordings from calyceal synapses in the
brainstem, furthermore, detected an increase in Ca2+ transients
without change in spike shape upon depolarization, whether elicited
by activation of presynaptic glycine receptors (13) or by direct
current injection (14). The principles governing analog–digital
modulation at large calyceal synapses may not, however, apply to far
more abundant small presynaptic boutons of the forebrain, arguing
the need for alternative recording methods to resolve the role of
spike broadening. Presynaptic voltage-sensitive fluorescence measurements or loose patch clamp of fluorescent-dye–loaded axons
may not detect submillisecond differences in action potential shape.
To resolve the role of spike broadening by direct recording while
avoiding the pitfalls of axon blebs, we used a variant of scanning ion
conductance microscopy [hopping probe ion conductance microscopy (HPICM)] (15) to identify small intact presynaptic boutons in
mouse hippocampal cultures for patch clamp. We have previously
reported that boutons thus identified express sodium, potassium,
and calcium channels (16), the full complement of channels required for action potential invasion and neurotransmitter release.
We focus on the role of Kv1.1, a member of the Kv1 potassium
channel family, which is expressed in the axons of pyramidal neurons (17). We show that action potential width recorded at the
bouton is increased by relatively brief subthreshold depolarizing
current injected at the soma of the same neuron. We further ask
how Kv1.1 modulates spike shape and identify an unexpected difference between the effects of pharmacological and genetic deletion of Kv1.1 on the one hand and a dominant disease-associated
missense mutation of the same subunit on the other.
Significance
Synaptic transmission depends on all-or-none action potentials.
However, subthreshold membrane potential fluctuations at the
cell body spread passively along the axon and affect the shape of
presynaptic action potentials, calcium influx, and neurotransmitter release. Here we apply a superresolution method to identify
small presynaptic terminals for patch clamp. Subthreshold modulation of action potentials is abolished by a mutation in the
potassium channel Kv1.1 associated with the neurological channelopathy episodic ataxia type 1. Surprisingly, pharmacological or
genetic ablation of Kv1.1 fails to prevent subthreshold modulation. Kv1.1 deletion and mutation have distinct effects on the
composition and voltage sensitivity of presynaptic channels and
consequently on modulation of neurotransmitter release.

Results
We first obtained a somatic whole-cell recording (Fig. 1A), and
then used HPICM to obtain a high-resolution 3D topographical
image of a small region within 100 μm of the patched soma,
looking for a candidate bouton for patch clamp (Fig. 1B). We applied the following criteria: first, the bouton should be situated
on top or to one side of, a dendrite, and part of its surface should be
accessible to the vertical scanning nanopipette; second, axons connected to the bouton should be detected; and third, it should be
clearly distinct from other neuronal structures. The scanning pipette
tip was subsequently broken to widen its orifice by lowering it rapidly
on an exposed region of the coverslip (16), before returning it to the
identified bouton and obtaining a whole-cell patch-clamp recording.
In ∼24% of cases, action potentials elicited at the soma were detected at the bouton, confirming that both pipettes recorded from
the same neuron (Fig. 1C). The red fluorescent tracer Alexa Fluor
568 routinely included in the bouton pipette labeled neighboring
boutons either side of the targeted structure, providing morphological confirmation of the axon identity (Fig. 1D) and showing that
the axon was not transected. The axon typically could not be traced
back to the cell body because of its tortuous route. Nevertheless, the
spike latency was nonsignificantly longer in the bouton than in the
somatic recording (average ± SD soma–bouton difference: 0.02 ±
0.10 ms, n = 53), consistent with action potential initiation at the
axon initial segment and a mean distance of 200–300 μm (9).
Of the Kv1 potassium channel family, Kv1.1 activates and,
depending on coassembled subunits, inactivates at relatively negative membrane potentials (18, 19). It is widely expressed throughout the CNS (20, 21), including the axons of pyramidal neurons
(17), and is therefore a strong candidate to mediate the effect of
subthreshold somatic de- and hyperpolarization on presynaptic
spike shape. We asked whether channels containing the Kv1.1
subunit affect spike width by examining the effect of acute application of the selective blocker dendrotoxin-K (DTx-K, 20 nM) (22)
on action potentials elicited by somatic depolarizing current pulses.
The half-width of action potentials recorded at the soma was unaffected (Fig. 2A and Fig. S1). However, DTx-K application led to
a 13 ± 3% (mean ± SEM) broadening of the action potential simultaneously recorded at the bouton (Fig. 2 A and B), consistent
with targeting of the channel to the axon.
We interleaved simultaneous somatic–bouton recordings in cultures obtained from wild-type (WT) and Kcna1−/− mice lacking
Kv1.1 (23). Although somatic action potential width was not significantly different between genotypes, deletion of Kv1.1 broadened
the presynaptic spike width by ∼25% (Kcna1−/−
: 1.43 ± 0.1 ms, n =
9; WT: 1.12 ± 0.04 ms, n = 29; Fig. S2 A and B). As expected,
DTx-K had little or no effect on simultaneously recorded bouton or
somatic spike width in Kcna1−/− neurons (Fig. S2 C and D).
We compared the effect of pharmacological and genetic deletion
of Kv1.1 to a mouse knockin model of episodic ataxia type 1 (EA1),
a channelopathy caused by heterozygous mutations in the Kv1.1-
encoding gene Kcna1 (24, 25). Kv1.1 coassembles with other
members of the Kv1 family, and several EA1-associated mutations
exert a dominant negative effect on other K+ channel subunits (26–
28). The Kcna1V408A/+ mouse model of EA1 (29) therefore allows
the effect of disrupting the normal composition of heteromultimeric
Kv1 channels to be studied. Similar to Kcna1−/− neurons, presynaptic
spikes were 25% broader in neurons from Kcna1V408A/+ than wildtype mice (Kcna1V408A/+
: 1.40 ± 0.06 ms, n = 13; WT: 1.12 ±
0.04 ms, see above; Fig. 2C). Furthermore, as in Kcna1−/− neurons,
DTx-K was ineffective in Kcna1V408A/+ neurons, either in somatic
(Fig. 2D and Fig. S3) or in bouton recordings (Fig. 2 D and E).

Broadening of spike width by DTx-K in wild-type neurons was
also observed in experiments where a somatic recording was not
obtained and where action potentials were elicited by current injection at the bouton (Fig. S4). DTx-K also failed to broaden
spikes in Kcna1−/− and Kcna1V408A/+ boutons in this recording
configuration, consistent with the results obtained with simultaneous soma–bouton recordings.
These data show directly that Kv1.1 affects spike shape at the
bouton. To investigate the role of Kv1.1 in the interplay of analog
and digital signaling, we restricted our attention to neurons where
paired somatic–bouton recordings were obtained. We examined
the effect of injecting somatic currents ranging between –100 and
+50 pA immediately before a suprathreshold somatic depolarizing
current. Prepulses were 200 ms in duration, approximating the
time course of subthreshold excitatory postsynaptic potentials (1).
No current was injected via the bouton pipette, thereby avoiding
any errors arising from imperfect bridge balance.
In neurons from wild-type mice the presynaptic action potential
width showed a positive dependence on the prepulse, consistent
with voltage-dependent inactivation of K+ currents (Fig. 3A). This
relationship persisted when spike width was plotted against the
voltage of the bouton membrane before the somatic depolarizing
pulse used to evoke spiking (Fig. 3A). To quantify this dependence,
we calculated the Spearman rank correlation coefficient ρ between
the prepulse current (or bouton voltage) and the spike width in
each experiment. The null hypothesis that ρ should be randomly
distributed around 0 was rejected at P < 0.005 (n = 20, Wilcoxon
signed-rank test; Fig. S5A). In parallel, to compare across neurons,
we normalized the half-width measured in each neuron by the
average width measured with –100- and –50-pA prepulses (Fig. 3B,
filled symbols). This showed a consistent upward-concave relationship. Spike broadening was not accompanied by a detectable
change in spike height.
DTx-K had no significant effect on prepulse-dependent spike
broadening (n = 18; dependence on prepulse current remained
significant at P < 0.001, Wilcoxon signed rank test; Fig. 3B, open
symbols). The modulation of spike width by subthreshold prepulses was unaffected by the drug UK-78282 (200 nM), which has
been reported to block Kv1.3 and Kv1.4 channels (30) (Fig. S6).
Moreover, when the same protocol was repeated in neurons from
Kcna1−/− mice, a positive relationship between spike width and
prepulse amplitude persisted (n = 9; Fig. 3C and Fig. S7). These
results indicate that, contrary to expectation, Kv1.1 is not necessary for digital–analog modulation.
In striking contrast to pharmacological or genetic deletion of
Kv1.1, prepulses had no effect on spike width in Kcna1V408A/+
neurons (Fig. 4 A and B; n = 10; Wilcoxon signed-rank test for ρ vs.
somatic subthreshold current or bouton voltage: P = 0.8; Fig. S5B).
The distributions of Spearman rank correlation coefficients in
Kcna1V408A/+ and wild-type neurons were significantly different
(P < 0.03, Mann–Whitney u test). Moreover, the normalized spike
widths at 0 or 50 pA were significantly different (P = 0.05 and 0.02,
respectively; unpaired t tests). The same conclusion held when
Kcna1V408A/+ neurons were compared only to wild-type littermates
(n = 10) recorded on the same days (normalized half-width for 0-
and +50-pA prepulses: P = 0.02 and 0.01, respectively; Fig. S8). We
further verified that the difference between wild-type and
Kcna1V408A/+ neurons persisted when longer prepulses lasting 2 s
were applied (9) (Fig. S9).
A possible explanation for the unexpected consequence of the
heterozygous V408A mutation is that it alters the stoichiometry of
Kv1 channels. We therefore asked whether the relative abundance
of different Kv1 subunits differs in cortical synaptosomes from
adult wild-type and Kcna1V408A/+ mice. We concentrated on
Kv1.1, Kv1.2, Kv1.3, Kv1.4, and Kv1.6, which are expressed in the
CNS. None of the specific imunoreactive signals, normalized to
the corresponding SNAP25 band intensity, differed significantly
between wild-type and Kcna1V408A/+ mice, although there were
nonsignificant trends for lower Kv1.3 and higher Kv1.6 (Fig. S10).
Discussion
The present study shows that brief subthreshold somatic depolarization robustly broadens presynaptic spikes in small boutons of untransected axons. The prepulses used here lasted either
200 ms or 2 s, comparable to excitatory postsynaptic potentials
propagating passively from the soma (1). The data thus fill a gap in
the evidence that action potential width modulation by relatively
brief subthreshold somatic depolarizations occurs in intact axons.
At hippocampal mossy fiber synapses, presynaptic spike broadening leads to a proportional increase in Ca2+ influx (31), and a
similar principle underlies signaling at basket cell terminals in the
cerebellar cortex (32). Assuming a Ca2+ current cooperativity ∼2
(33, 34), the ∼12% analog spike broadening seen here (Fig. 3B) is
predicted to increase neurotransmitter release by ∼25%.

This study also reveals an unexpected dissociation between the
effects of manipulating Kv1.1 on the basal presynaptic spike width
and on the modulation of spike width by membrane potential
changes propagating passively from the soma. Pharmacological
blockade or homozygous deletion of Kv1.1 broadened the action
potential recorded in boutons but did not prevent the effect of
subthreshold prepulses. This finding argues that, despite its relatively negative activation and inactivation kinetics, Kv1.1 is not
absolutely necessary for spike width modulation by prepulses
lasting 200 ms. Subthreshold modulation of spike width also
persisted in the presence of a blocker of Kv1.3 and Kv1.4 channels. A heterozygous missense mutation of the Kv1.1-encoding
gene Kcna1, in contrast, completely abolished the effect of prepulses on spike width, even though the basal spike width was no
greater than when Kv1.1 was deleted.
The results are particularly unexpected in the light of what is
known of the functional consequences of the V408A mutation. In
contrast to some EA1-associated mutations, the V408A mutation
expressed in Xenopus oocytes has a relatively subtle effect on
current density, voltage threshold, activation kinetics, and heterotetramerization (26, 28, 35–37). Furthermore the mutation paradoxically retards N-type inactivation, implying a gain of function
that might offset a mild deleterious effect on channel function
(38). Nevertheless, the mutation is embryonal-lethal in the homozygous state (29), unlike the homozygous null mutation, which
is compatible with survival to adulthood in mice (23). A possible
explanation for the results is that Xenopus oocyte recordings underestimate the severity of the dominant negative effect of the

V408A mutation, resulting in functional loss of a wide range of
Kv1 channels. Nevertheless, quantitative immunoblotting failed to
reveal a substantial change in the relative proportion of different
members of the Kv1 family in cortical synaptosomes. Homozygous
deletion of Kv1.1, in contrast, may lead to the formation of Kv1
channel stoichiometries that are able to substitute for Kv1.1-containing heteromultimers. Such channels most likely have kinetics
that are slower or require a larger depolarization to activate,
explaining the prolongation of the spike width, and yet undergo a
similar slow inactivation upon sustained depolarization, explaining
the persistence of analog modulation of spike width.
Axonal Kv1 channels have also been implicated in shunting
somatodendritic plateau potentials, thereby allowing attenuated
spikes to repolarize fully and amplify as they propagate to the
distal axon (39). This phenomenon has been studied with axon
blebs and requires much larger depolarizations than the spike
broadening studied here, although it occurs with a similar time
course. The dependence of shunting on activation, and spike
broadening on inactivation, of voltage-gated channels hints at
functional heterogeneity of axonal channels composed of different Kv1 subunits.
Episodic ataxia type 1 is dominated by paroxysms of cerebellar
incoordination and myokymia (25). These are most likely attributable to abnormal GABA release from cerebellar basket cells
(29) and to motor axon hyperexcitability, respectively (40), both
sites where Kv1.1 is especially abundantly expressed (20, 21, 40,
41). Indeed, presynaptic spike broadening has been demonstrated
at these terminals in the Kcna1V408A/+ mouse (32). Nevertheless,
epilepsy occurs in a high proportion of affected individuals (25,
27), implying a role in circuit excitability in the forebrain. Whether
impairment of analog–digital modulation contributes to this feature of the disease remains to be determined.
Materials and Methods
Neuronal Cultures and Recording Solutions. Experiments conformed to the
Animals (Scientific Procedures) Act 1986, and were approved by the ethics
committee of the UCL Institute of Neurology. Kcna1V408A/+ female mice were
crossed with wild-type C57/BL6 mice. Hippocampal neurons were isolated from
P1–P2 mouse pups and cultured in neurobasal-based medium either on an astrocyte feeder layer or on poly-D-lysine–treated coverslips. All recordings were
conducted at ambient temperature (23 °C–26 °C) 12–19 d after plating. The
standard extracellular solution used in all experiments contained 125 mM NaCl,
2.5 mM KCl, 2 mM MgCl2, 2 mM CaCl2, 30 mM glucose, 0.01 mM NBQX,
0.05 mM (2R)-amino-5-phosphonovaleric acid (APV), and 25 mM Hepes (pH 7.4).
High-Resolution Scanning. Topographic images were obtained using a custommodified HPICM sample scanner (ICNano-S by Ionscope) and custom software
as described previously (16). The scan head was mounted on an inverted
Olympus IX71 microscope, with the nanopipette held vertically. Alexa Fluor
568 epifluorescence images were obtained using a Cool White LED
(OptoLED, Cairn Research) and a 520- to 570-nm band-pass excitation filter,
a 565-nm long-pass dichroic mirror, and a 590-nm long-pass emission filter,
and collected using an Evolve 512 EM-CCD camera (Photometrics).
Fine-tipped nanopipettes, used both to probe the neuronal topography and to obtain patch-clamp recordings, were pulled from borosilicate
glass (o.d. 1 mm, i.d. 0.5 mm; Sutter Instruments) using a laser puller
(P-2000, Sutter Instruments). The pipette resistance was in the range of
80–110 MΩ, corresponding to an estimated inner tip diameter of 90–125
nm, before chopping for whole-bouton recordings. Nanopipettes were
held in voltage-clamp mode with a Multiclamp 700B patch-clamp amplifier (Molecular Devices).
Whole-Cell Patch Recordings. A soma was patched under light microscopy
using a 3–5 MΩ conventional patch pipette filled with 130 mM K gluconate,
10 mM KOH-Hepes, 1 mM KOH-EGTA, 10 mM KCl, 4 mM Mg-ATP, 0.5 mM
Na-GTP (pH 7.35 with KOH). The nanopipette used for HPICM contained the
same internal solution supplemented with 200 μM Alexa Fluor 568 (Invitrogen).
After obtaining a high-resolution image of a candidate bouton, identified as
above or adjacent to a dendrite and supplied by an axon, the nanopipette was
broken on an area of bare coverslip as previously described (16). The widened
pipette (resistance 30–45 MΩ, corresponding to an inner tip diameter of 300–450
nm) was returned to the bouton to obtain a whole-cell recording and switched
to current clamp mode. In a subset of experiments where the soma and bouton
were not from the same cell, presynaptic spike widths were recorded by injecting
current into the bouton after balancing the bridge (Fig. S4). In all other cases,
spikes were evoked via the somatic pipette, and the bouton was recorded passively. Recordings were filtered at 5 kHz, digitized at 10 kHz, and acquired and
analyzed off-line with custom LabVIEW (National Instruments) software. Cells
where action potentials did not exceed 0 mV were discarded. The spike take-off
point was estimated from the peak of the second time derivative of voltage, and
spike half-width was measured at the half-way voltage between take-off and
peak. Where several spikes were elicited, only the first was analyzed. For experiments where a bouton recording was obtained without a somatic recording,
spikes were elicited with a 10-ms, 50-pA current injection. To assess analog
modulation, 200-ms-long prepulses of amplitude –100 pA, –50 pA, 0 pA, and
+50 pA were applied at the soma before a 200-ms-long depolarizing (+200 pA)
pulse to elicit one or more action potentials. If a spike occurred before the
+200-pA pulse, the trial was discarded. Protocols were repeated 30 times,
before and after perfusion of 20 nM DTx-K, allowing 90 s for equilibration,
and the data are shown as averages of the repetitions. No differences in
resting membrane potential, input resistance or spike height were observed between genotypes or when comparing recordings before and after
DTx-K application.
Drugs and Toxins. AMPA, NMDA, GABAA, and GABAB receptors were routinely
blocked with 10 μM 2,3-dihydroxy-6-nitro-7-sulfamoyl-benzo[f]quinoxaline2,3-dione, 50 μM (2R)-amino-5-phosphonovaleric acid, 100 μM picrotoxin, and
1 μM CGP 52432. DTx-K (20 nM) was used to block Kv1.1 channels. APV was
from Ascent. DTx-K and UK-78282 were from Alomone Labs. All other compounds were purchased from Tocris.
Pure Synaptosome Preparation. Pure synaptosomes were prepared using
protocols adapted from refs. 42, 43. Brain cortices from four wild-type or
four Kcna1V408A/+ mice (6–8 wk old) were homogenized in 10 volumes of ice-cold
Hepes-buffered sucrose (320 mM sucrose, 4 mM Hepes, pH 7.4, protease inhibitor mixture; Sigma S8830) using a motor driven glass-Teflon homogenizer at
∼900 rpm with 15 gentle strokes. The homogenate was centrifuged at 1,000 × g
for 10 min at 4 °C in a Ti 70.1 rotor (Beckman). The pellet (P1) was discarded and
the supernatant (S1) was centrifuged at 10,000 × g for 15 min in the same rotor.
The resulting pellet (P2) was resuspended in 10 volumes of Hepes-buffered sucrose and then respun at 10,000 × g for a further 15 min to yield a washed crude
synaptosomal fraction. The supernatant was removed and the synaptosomeenriched pellet (P2′) was resuspended in 4 mL of homogenization buffer. The P2′
fraction was then layered onto 3 mL of 1.2 M sucrose (supplemented with 4 mM
Hepes pH 7.4, protease inhibitors), and centrifuged at 230,000 × g for 15 min in
an SW55 Ti swinging bucket rotor (Beckman). The synaptosomes were recovered
at the interface of Hepes-buffered sucrose and 1.2 M sucrose and diluted to 8 mL
with ice-cold Hepes-buffered sucrose. The samples were then layered onto 4 mL
of 0.8 M sucrose (supplemented with 4 mM Hepes pH 7.4, protease inhibitors)
and centrifuged at 230,000 × g for 15 min in a Ti 70.1 rotor (Beckman). The
resulting pellet containing pure synaptomes was resuspended in lysis buffer [1%
Nonidet P-40, 50 mM Tris·HCl (pH 8), 150 mM NaCl, and 2 mM EDTA, protease
inhibitor] and the protein concentration was then determined with a Bio-Rad
protein assay solution with BSA as a standard.
Western Blot Analyses. Equal amounts of proteins (30 μg per lane) from pure
synaptosomal fraction of wild-type or Kcna1V408A/+ KI mice were separated by
SDS/PAGE using Bis-Tris gradient gels (4–12% NuPAGE; Invitrogen) according
to the manufacturer’s recommendations and electrophoretically transferred
onto Immobilon-P transfer membranes (Millipore). Membranes were immunoblotted with the respective antibodies: rabbit anti-Kv1.1 (APC-161, Alomone
Labs; 1:800), anti-Kv1.2 (APC-010, 1:1,500), anti-Kv1.3 (APC-101, 1:1,000), antiKv1.4 (APC-167, 1:500), anti-Kv1.6 (APC-003, 1:2,000), and anti-SNAP25 (Abcam
ab5666; 1:2,000) at 4 °C overnight. Blots were then exposed to horseradish
peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG (17210, Bio-Rad Laboratories,
1:5,000) for 1 h at room temperature. Blots were developed using ECL-Prime
(GE Healthcare), visualized via a ChemiDoc Touch Imaging System, and analyzed using Image Lab 5.2 software (Bio-Rad Laboratories). For the quantifications, the signal intensity of each of the Kv1 bands was normalized to the
signal intensity of the corresponding SNAP25 bands, and then the Kcna1V408A/+
synaptosomes were expressed as a percentage of wild type.
