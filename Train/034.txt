Molecular and electrophysiological evidence for net
synaptic potentiation in wake and depression in sleep
Vladyslav V Vyazovskiy1,3, Chiara Cirelli1,3, Martha Pfister-Genskow1, Ugo Faraguna1,2 & Giulio Tononi1
Plastic changes occurring during wakefulness aid in the acquisition and consolidation of memories. For some memories, further
consolidation requires sleep, but whether plastic processes during wakefulness and sleep differ is unclear. We show that, in rat
cortex and hippocampus, GluR1-containing AMPA receptor (AMPAR) levels are high during wakefulness and low during sleep,
and changes in the phosphorylation states of AMPARs, CamKII and GSK3b are consistent with synaptic potentiation during
wakefulness and depression during sleep. Furthermore, slope and amplitude of cortical evoked responses increase after
wakefulness, decrease after sleep and correlate with changes in slow-wave activity, a marker of sleep pressure. Changes in
molecular and electrophysiological indicators of synaptic strength are largely independent of the time of day. Finally, cortical
long-term potentiation can be easily induced after sleep, but not after wakefulness. Thus, wakefulness appears to be associated
with net synaptic potentiation, whereas sleep may favor global synaptic depression, thereby preserving an overall balance of
synaptic strength.

The brain is remarkably plastic, and plastic changes occur not only
as a result of experience and learning, but even in response to
variations in spontaneous activity1,2. Persistent plastic changes in
neural circuits, such as long-term potentiation (LTP) and depression
(LTD) of synaptic strength, involve a complex series of molecular
and cellular mechanisms, including receptor delivery and phosphorylation. These changes are associated in turn with an increased
or decreased efficacy of synapses, as measured by the strength of
postsynaptic currents3.
In principle, synaptic potentiation and depression could occur in
parallel, ensuring that total synaptic strength remains balanced at all
times. Indeed, large imbalances, especially in the direction of potentiation, could be detrimental because of known constraints related to
energy, space, cellular supplies and saturation of the ability to learn4,5.
Alternatively, a homeostasis of synaptic strength could be maintained
over time by alternating phases of predominant potentiation with
phases of predominant depression. It was suggested recently that, at
least in adult animals, waking plasticity may be associated preferentially
with net synaptic potentiation in the cerebral cortex and other brain
regions, whereas sleep, especially non–rapid eye movement (NREM)
sleep, would redress the balance by favoring global synaptic depression
or downscaling5. However, this possibility has not been tested directly.
Moreover, several learning studies that showed performance improvements after sleep have prompted the idea that sleep may favor the
strengthening of neural circuits that are activated during the prior
waking period6,7. Thus, it is currently a matter of great interest whether
plastic processes during waking and sleep differ, and if so, in which way.
Here we provide molecular and electrophysiological evidence in rats

suggesting that periods of wakefulness are associated with a net increase
in cortical synaptic strength and periods of sleep are associated with
a net decrease.
RESULTS
GluR1-containing AMPAR levels
To shed light on these issues, we employed a combined molecular and
electrophysiological approach. At the molecular level, the best established mechanism for the expression of LTP and LTD involves the
trafficking of postsynaptic glutamatergic AMPARs containing the
GluR1 subunit8,9. The delivery of these receptors to excitatory synapses
is associated with increases in synaptic strength, whereas their removal
from synapses is associated with synaptic depression8,9. These changes
have been recently described in vivo in the cerebral cortex, hippocampus
and amygdala, where they can be triggered by learning and natural
experience10–14. More specifically, recent in vivo studies have shown that
LTP and learning are associated with the delivery of AMPARs to synaptoneurosomes, a preparation that enriches for synaptic proteins,
whereas LTD is associated with their removal10,15. To compare the
density of GluR1-containing AMPARs between sleep and wakefulness,
we implanted adult rats with bipolar concentric local field potential
(LFP) electrodes for chronic polysomnographic recordings and assigned
them to the waking group if they remained spontaneously awake for
475% of the first 6 h of the dark period (Fig. 1a; see Methods). Other
rats were assigned to the sleep group if they remained asleep for 475%
of the first 6 h of the light period (Fig. 1a). We measured protein levels
of GluR1-containing AMPARs in the cerebral cortex by western blot in
both total homogenates and cortical synaptoneurosomes (Fig. 1b). The

phosphorylation at Ser831 (refs. 10,18), which enhances single-channel
conductance8. Compared with the sleeping group, the waking group
showed increased absolute levels of GluR1 phosphorylation at Ser831
(63 ± 11%, P ¼ 0.0001; Fig. 1b), whereas the relative levels (normalized
to total GluR1) did not change (20 ± 15%, P ¼ 0.77). Ser831 is a
substrate for calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II (CaMKII), and increased levels of CaMKII and CamKII phosphorylation at
Thr286 are also associated with synaptic potentiation and LTP, both
in vitro and in vivo19. Compared with the sleeping group, the waking
group showed increased levels of CamKII that was phosphorylated at
Thr286 (39 ± 13%, P ¼ 0.016; Fig. 1b), whereas the increase in total
CamKII protein levels did not reach significance (waking, 16 ± 10% of
sleeping, P ¼ 0.34). Consistent with previous studies16, we also found
that waking animals had higher levels of BDNF, Arc, NGFI-A and PCREB, which are usually associated in vivo with LTP (data not shown).

entire left cortical hemisphere was sampled, as we found in previous
experiments that, when rats wake up, the expression of activitydependent, plasticity-related genes such as Fos, Egr1 (also known as
Ngfi-A), Arc, phosphorylated Creb1 and Bdnf increase over most cortical
regions, including frontal, parietal, temporal and occipitals areas16.
Compared with the sleep group, the waking group showed a nearly
50% increase in total GluR1 levels in synaptoneurosomes (46 ± 12%,
mean ± s.e.m., paired t-test, P ¼ 0.0015; Fig. 1b). In contrast, no
changes were observed in total homogenates between sleeping and
waking animals in cortical GluR1 levels (data not shown), which is
consistent with previous reports in vivo (for example, see refs. 10,15).
For this reason, all of the remaining western blots were run in synaptoneurosomes. Protein levels of glutamatergic NMDA NR2A subunits,
which can promote surface expression of GluR1-containing AMPARs17,
also showed a trend toward higher values in the waking group (Fig. 1b).
The net increase of GluR1-containing
AMPARs shown here is similar in magnitude
to increases triggered by learning and plastia
city procedures in vivo10–13,15. This suggests
that, on average, cortical glutamatergic
synapses may be stronger after periods of
wakefulness and weaker after periods of sleep.

Is the net change in synaptic GluR1-containing

changes are known to affect the surface incorporation and the channel properties of
AMPARs. In vivo, synaptic potentiation is

Suggested molecular fingerprints of synaptic depression, on the
other hand, include the dephosphorylation of GluR1 at Ser845,
which occurs both in vitro and in vivo15,20 and leads to a decrease in
the channel open probability and to AMPARs internalization8. Both
absolute (74 ± 10% of waking, P o 0.026) and relative (80 ± 9% of
waking, P o 0.036) levels of GluR1 phosphorylation at Ser845 were
lower in the sleeping group relative to the waking group (Fig. 1b).
Similar changes in cerebral cortex and hippocampus
Wakefulness and sleep are global phenomena associated with changes
in firing patterns and neuromodulation in most forebrain structures,
including the hippocampal formation21. Do molecular correlates of
synaptic potentiation in wakefulness and depression in sleep extend to
brain areas other than the cerebral cortex? To find out, we measured the
density and phosphorylation levels of AMPARs in hippocampal
synaptoneurosomes that were prepared from the same animals in
which we tested cortical synapsoneurosomes. We confirmed most of
the results that we obtained in the cerebral cortex in the hippocampus,
with a few notable differences (Fig. 1c). For example, NR2A levels in

the hippocampus showed a significant increase in waking relative to
sleeping (P o 0.05), whereas in the cerebral cortex there was only a
trend (P ¼ 0.09). We also examined the phosphorylation at Ser9 of
glycogen synthase kinase–3b (GSK3b) in the hippocampus, an enzyme
associated with native AMPARs. GSK3b phosphorylation at Ser9 has
recently been shown to increase during hippocampal LTP and decrease
during LTD, with no change in total expression22. We found that
hippocampal protein levels of GSK3b phosphorylated at Ser9 were
significantly higher in waking than in sleeping rats (18 ± 5%, P ¼ 0.018;
Fig. 1c), whereas total GSK3b levels were similar (data not shown).
It should be noted that, in both cerebral cortex and hippocampus,
changes in GluR1 levels between wakefulness and sleep were not
associated with similar changes in GluR2 levels (Fig. 1b,c). Unlike
GluR2-containing AMPARs, GluR2-lacking AMPARs are permeable to
calcium, and may be crucial for LTP maintenance23. Although
some previous in vivo studies found parallel changes in both subunits10,15,20, others observed a selective increase in GluR1-containing
AMPARs11–13,24. In the hippocampus, this increase disappeared 25 min
after electrically induced LTP24, whereas in the cerebral cortex it was

Figure 3 Effect of behavioral state on the LFP responses. LFPs were
collected during spontaneous NREM sleep, REM sleep, quiet waking (QW)
and active waking (AW). Mean values of LFPs slopes recorded in the first
1–2 h after light onset (high sleep pressure) and after 4–6 h of undisturbed
sleep (low sleep pressure) in the four behavioral states. For each individual
animal, the values of the slopes for each of the two conditions (High and
Low) are expressed as the percengate of the mean between them before
averaging among animals. Values are mean ± s.e.m. (n ¼ 9 rats, *P o 0.05,

still present after 1 d of single-whisker stimulation11, or after 7 d of dark
rearing13. Thus, whether and when GluR1-containing AMPARs are
eventually replaced by GluR2-containing AMPARs remains an open
question and may depend on experimental conditions23. In summary,
wakefulness is associated with an increased number of AMPAR GluR1
subunits and with an increased expression of phosphorylated CamKII.
Sleep is associated instead with a decreased number of AMPAR GluR1
subunits and with the dephosphorylation of GluR1 at Ser845. These
data provide molecular evidence that is consistent with the occurrence
of net synaptic potentiation during wakefulness and synaptic depression during sleep in two large forebrain areas, the cerebral cortex and
the hippocampus.
Cortical evoked responses
Although molecular markers of LTP and LTD are strongly indicative of
corresponding changes in synaptic strength, it is important to determine directly whether synaptic efficacy is altered and whether it is
altered in vivo. In freely behaving animals, this can be done by
measuring LFP responses that are evoked by electrical stimulation.
Specifically, the strength of population excitatory postsynaptic currents
is reflected by the slope of LFPs evoked by electrical stimuli25. Accordingly, in vivo LTP-inducing procedures increase LFP slope26,27, whereas
LTD procedures reduce it (for example, see ref. 28). To evaluate changes
in synaptic efficacy as a function of preceding waking and sleeping, we
implanted two other groups of animals with bipolar concentric
electrodes for electrical stimulation and chronic intracortical LFP
recordings. We recorded LFPs from the left frontal cortex after electrical
stimulation of the right frontal cortex (Fig. 2a). We then measured the
slope of the first negative component of this transcallosal evoked
response. We focused on the cerebral cortex because, together with
the thalamus, it generates the characteristic electrical rhythms of
mammalian sleep1, and it has a central role in several hypotheses
concerning the functions of sleep (see references in ref. 5). Also, the
frontal cortex, relative to other cortical regions, shows the most
substantial increase in sleep pressure after prolonged wakefulness, as
measured by the increase in slow-wave activity (SWA) in the cortical
electroencephalogram (EEG) (EEG power between 0.5 and 4 Hz)29.
Furthermore, the impaired functioning of frontal cortical areas is
thought to underlie several of the cognitive defects observed after
sleep deprivation (see references in ref. 5). We focused on the
transcallosal response because the corpus callosum consists of a
distinct, isolated and homogenous bundle of excitatory fibers, and
thus the early monosynaptic component of the evoked response can be

identified. Indeed, this early component followed high-frequency
stimulation rates up to 100 Hz (Fig. 2b) and met several other criteria
used to define monosynaptic responses (Supplementary Fig. 1 online).
To avoid confounding effects of behavioral state on evoked responses,
we carefully monitored the behavior of each rat using LFPs, muscle
activity and direct visual observation, and recorded the evoked LFPs
under standardized conditions of quiet wakefulness (see Methods). In
this way, we could examine the effects of the preceding sleep-waking
history on evoked LFPs that had been recorded in exactly the same
behavioral state.
When sleep pressure is low, usually at the end of the light phase,
some rats wake up and stay awake for a consolidated period of several
hours. Conversely, at the beginning of the light phase, when sleep
pressure is high, some animals enter a consolidated period of sleep that
may last for 2 h or more. When we measured LFP responses in rats that
had remained awake without interruption for 3–4 h between two LFPs
recording sessions, we found that the slope of the first LFP component
increased, on average, by 22% from the beginning to the end of the
continuous waking period (Fig. 2c; for the distribution of individual
responses, see Supplementary Fig. 2 online). The increase in slope was
also observed after equating for response amplitude (Supplementary
Fig. 3 online). In contrast, for rats that had been almost continuously
asleep during the first 4 h of the light phase, the slope of the first LFP
component decreased by almost 20% between the two recording
sessions (Fig. 2d; for the distribution of individual responses, see
Supplementary Fig. 2). Again, the decrease in slope was present after
equating for response amplitude (Supplementary Fig. 3). Because
some rats remained spontaneously awake for only 0.5–2 h, we recorded
LFPs at shorter time intervals in these animals (after 0.5, 1 and 2 h of
wakefulness). Overall, by analyzing all responses after spontaneous
waking periods ranging from o30 min to B4 h, we found a
progressive increase in the slope that became significant after 1 h of
wakefulness (Fig. 2e, one-way ANOVA, factor ‘waking duration’,
F ¼ 10.0, P o 0.001) and increased substantially by the end of the
waking period. Conversely, the slope of the responses decreased
significantly (P ¼ 0.019) after at least 2 h of continuous sleep
(Fig. 2e). Thus, an electrophysiological indicator of synaptic efficacy,
the slope of the early component of cortical evoked potentials, was high
after spontaneous wakefulness and low after spontaneous sleep. Moreover, we observed that the longer the preceding period of continuous
wakefulness, the larger the increase in slope. In contrast, the longer the
preceding period of sleep, the smaller the slope of the response.
Notably, in our experiments, rats were never spontaneously awake
for more than 3–4 h, as expected because they are polyphasic animals.
These periods of continuous wakefulness, however, were sufficient to
produce changes in the slope of the evoked response of B20%.
Changes of similar magnitude have been reported in a recent in vivo
study in the hippocampus after physiological learning10 (in vitro,
electrically induced hippocampal LTP is associated with slope increases
of 100% or more; for example, see ref. 30). We also measured changes
in the amplitude of the evoked responses, as amplitude is often used as
an additional marker of synaptic efficacy31. We found that the amplitude of the evoked LFPs also increased after 4 h of wakefulness and
decreased after 2 h of sleep, although to a lesser extent than the slope
(Fig. 2f). Notably, both the slope and amplitude of LFPs were stable in
each recording session, indicating that no measurable plastic changes
occurred in relation to the stimulation procedure per se (Fig. 2g).
Finally, we examined whether the slope of the evoked responses
and the duration of the periods of continuous wakefulness or
the amount of NREM sleep during the preceding 3–4 h were correlated.
To do so, we collected evoked responses approximately every 4 h during

Cortical evoked responses and behavioral state
Although all recordings were carried out under strictly controlled
behavioral conditions of quiet wakefulness (animal immobile, eyes
open, low muscle tone, low-voltage, highfrequency cortical EEG activity), it is possible
a
that the sleep-waking history of the animal
may affect evoked LFPs not only by modifying
synaptic efficacy, but also through subtle
changes in neuromodulation and neuronal
excitability that might occur between high
and low sleep-pressure conditions. To address
this issue, we carried out additional experib
ments (n ¼ 9 rats) by collecting evoked LFPs
under both high and low sleep pressure in
four different behavioral states (active wakefulness, quiet wakefulness, NREM sleep and
Sn
REM sleep) that are associated with marked
changes in neuromodulation and excitability32. The results showed that, although the
amplitude of the early component of evoked

LFPs increased as expected33 in NREM sleep

relative to all the other behavioral states (oneKII-P

early component of evoked LFPs did not differ across the four
behavioral states (one-way ANOVA, factor ‘behavioral state’; high
sleep pressure, F ¼ 0.3, P ¼ 0.83; low sleep pressure, F ¼ 0.3, P ¼
0.81), indicating that major neuromodulatory changes had negligible
effects on this parameter. In contrast, when we compared the LFPs
collected under high sleep pressure (in the first 2 h after light onset) and
under low sleep pressure (after 4–6 h of undisturbed sleep) separately
for each of the four behavioral states, the slope of evoked LFPs
decreased by 15–20% not only in quiet wakefulness, confirming
our previous results, but also in active wakefulness, NREM sleep
and REM sleep (two-tailed paired t-test, P o 0.05; Fig. 3). Thus,
this experiment indicates that the decrease in the LFP slope
after a sustained period of sleep is independent of the actual
behavioral state during which the responses were collected, and
is unlikely to be accounted for by changes in neuromodulation
and excitability.

the 12-h light period (Fig. 2h). We found a significant correlation
in both cases, the slope of the response was highly positively correlated
with the duration of the preceding period of continuous waking
and negatively correlated with the amount of NREM sleep (waking,
r ¼ 0.47, P ¼ 0.0002; NREM, r ¼ –0.33, P ¼ 0.0035; Fig. 2h). The
slope of the response was also negatively correlated with the
amount of the preceding REM sleep, but not as strongly as with NREM
sleep (r ¼ –0.24, P ¼ 0.037). There was no significant correlation
between the slope of the response and the ratio REM/NREM sleep in
the preceding 3-h period (r ¼ –0.2, P ¼ 0.09; Supplementary Fig. 4
online), suggesting that NREM is more directly related than REM sleep
to the observed decrease in slope (NREM and REM sleep are strongly
correlated with each other).

Cortical evoked responses and brain temperature
Changes in brain temperature of as low as few degrees can alter evoked
responses34,35, raising the issue of whether the increase in slope that we
observed after prolonged waking could be due to, at least in part, an
increase in cortical temperature. Passive or active heating of the brain
increases the slope and decreases the latency of the evoked response,
and decreases the amplitude of the population spike34. However, in our
experiments, both the slope and amplitude of the downward (Fig. 2)
and upward (data not shown) segments of the LFP increased after
prolonged wakefulness, and the change in the slope persisted after
equating evoked responses on the basis of their latency (Supplementary Fig. 3). To investigate specifically whether brain temperature
changes in parallel with the LFP slope, we recorded brain temperature
in a subset of animals (n ¼ 7). In all of them, temperature increased
rapidly after the transition from sleep to wakefulness by 1.4 ± 0.2 1C,
and remained stable for the entire duration of the waking episode (oneway ANOVA, factor ‘waking duration’, F ¼ 0.63, n.s., Supplementary
Fig. 5 online). In contrast, the LFP slope showed a progressive increase
during the 4-h waking period (Supplementary Fig. 5) and no
significant correlation with brain temperature (r ¼ 0.03, P ¼ 0.9). In
summary, the observed changes in the slope and amplitude of cortical
evoked responses suggest that synaptic efficacy increases progressively
during wakefulness and decreases progressively during sleep.
Controlling for time of day and light
To ensure that the observed molecular and electrophysiological changes
are due to wakefulness and sleep, other confounding factors, such as
time of day or lighting conditions, must be ruled out. For this purpose,
additional animals were kept awake for several hours during the light
phase, when they would normally have slept, by presenting them with
novel objects that kept them busy and interested (enforced wakefulness
group). For the molecular analysis, enforced wakefulness rats were
killed at the same time of day as the sleeping group (Fig. 4a). Similar to
waking rats, enforced wakefulness rats had increased levels of total
GluR1 compared with sleeping rats (57 ± 16%, P ¼ 0.0059), but no
changes in the phosphorylation of GluR1 at Ser831 and in the
expression of NR2A (Fig. 4b). Like waking rats, enforced wakefulness
rats also showed significantly increased levels of CamKII phosphorylation at Thr286 (36 ± 9%, P ¼ 0.021) and a trend toward an increase in
total CamKII protein levels (enforced wakefulness, 20 ± 9% of S,
P ¼ 0.10). As in waking rats, no significant increases were seen in GluR2
(P ¼ 0.9) and NR2A (P ¼ 0.5) expression (Fig. 4b), whereas BDNF,
Arc, NGFI-A and P-CREB expression increased, as previously demonstrated (data not shown and ref. 16). On the other hand, compared
with the enforced wakefulness group, the sleeping group showed a
marked GluR1 dephosphorylation at Ser845, which in vivo is usually
associated with LTD (absolute levels, 73 ± 14% of enforced wakefulness,

P o 0.012; relative levels, 64 ± 4% of enforced wakefulness, P o 0.019;
Fig. 4b), just as observed in comparison to the waking group. Once
again, the results obtained in the hippocampus were similar (Fig. 4c).
Thus, several molecular correlates of LTP and LTD in cerebral cortex
and hippocampus appear to change as a function of wake and sleep
history, and not of time of day or light. On the other hand, time of day,
light conditions, or the duration and quality of prior wakefulness may
affect the phosphorylation of GluR1 at Ser831 and the expression of
NR2A, which showed no consistent change in the enforced wakefulness
and waking groups relative to the sleeping group.
For the electrophysiological analysis, another group of enforced
wakefulness rats were kept awake with novel objects for 4 h beyond
their usual sleep time (Fig. 5a). The slope of the first LFP component at
the end of the enforced wakefulness period was B20% higher than
after an equivalent period of sleep during a baseline recording, though
time of day and lighting conditions were the same (Fig. 4b; for the
distribution of individual responses, see Supplementary Fig. 2). Again,
the change in the slope persisted after equating evoked responses on the
basis of their latency (Supplementary Fig. 3). The slope of the LFP was
B13% higher after 4 h of enforced wakefulness compared with the end
of the dark phase, suggesting the possibility of a further increase in
synaptic efficacy with prolonged wakefulness (Fig. 5b). Once again,
LFP slope decreased significantly after recovery sleep (Fig. 5b). Thus,
slope increases after wakefulness and decreases after sleep in a manner
that is largely independent of time of day. Note, however, that our study
was not specifically designed to test a possible role of the circadian
system, as molecular and electrophysiological measurements were not
taken across the 24-h cycle under constant conditions. Thus, we cannot
rule out that, in addition to behavioral state, circadian time may also
affect markers of synaptic strength.
Cortical evoked responses and slow wave activity
SWA in the cortical EEG (SWA, the EEG power between 0.5 and 4 Hz)
increases in proportion to the time spent awake and decreases during
sleep. For this reason, SWA is thought to reflect the accumulation of
sleep need during wakefulness and its discharge during sleep29
(Fig. 6a), although the underlying mechanisms are unknown. Computer simulations36 have recently suggested that the level of sleep SWA
may reflect overall cortical synaptic strength; because of the effects on
neuronal recruitment and synchronization, stronger connections
should lead to larger slow waves and weaker connections to smaller
waves. Support for this hypothesis comes from experiments showing
that sleep SWA is increased globally and locally37 by procedures
presumably associated with synaptic potentiation, and decreased by
those presumably associated with synaptic depression38. We therefore
predicted that the increase in the slope of the LFP response after a
period of waking should be positively correlated with SWA at the

strong positive correlation (P ¼ 0.00006; Fig. 6d), suggesting that
changes in synaptic efficacy can be revealed by both electrically evoked
volleys and spontaneously generated volleys.
Altogether, these results indicate that the occurrence of consolidated
periods of NREM sleep, accompanied by a large decline in NREM
SWA, strongly predicts the ensuing decrease in the slope of evoked
LFPs, an in vivo marker of synaptic strength. Although these results are
correlative, they raise the intriguing possibility that slow waves, which
fall in a frequency range usually leading to synaptic depression, may not
just reflect synaptic strength, but may actively contribute to the
weakening of connections during sleep5,41.
Cortical evoked responses and LTP occlusion
If our finding that AMPAR density and the slope and amplitude of field
potential responses increase after periods of waking is indeed indicative
of a net increase in synaptic strength, and if the converse is the case after
periods of sleep, then it should be more difficult to induce LTP in
animals that have been awake for several hours than in animals that
have been awake for just a few minutes after a long period of sleep. In

beginning of the subsequent sleep period. On the other hand, the
decrease in the slope of the waking LFPs evoked before and after sleep
should be positively correlated with the decrease in SWA during sleep.
To test the first prediction, a subset of animals were constantly observed
during the 12-h dark period and presented with novel objects if they
showed signs of drowsiness. Evoked LFPs were collected every 4 h
during the preceding light period, as well as at the end of the 12-h
waking period, after which the rats were allowed to obtain undisturbed
sleep. As expected, at the end of the 12-h period of waking, slopes were
15.8 ± 3.7% above the mean over the baseline light period, when the
animals predominantly slept (n ¼ 5 rats, P ¼ 0.014, paired t-test).
Moreover, the increase in slope after the 12-h waking period was highly
correlated with both the mean (r ¼ 0.97, P ¼ 0.006) and the peak
(r ¼ 0.98, P ¼ 0.003) SWA of the first hour of NREM sleep
(Supplementary Fig. 6 online); thus, the larger the increase in slope
after waking, the larger the SWA at sleep onset. To test the second
prediction, we examined the relationship between the decline of LFP
slope across 4 h of sleep (baseline sleep, n ¼ 23 rats; recovery sleep after
enforced wakefulness, n ¼ 13 rats) and the decline of SWA. We found
that the larger the decline in the waking LFP slope, the larger the decline
in sleep SWA (r ¼ 0.36, P ¼ 0.03; Fig. 6b). Moreover, the decline in
slope was positively correlated with the total amount of NREM sleep
(P ¼ 0.015; Fig. 6c, left), as well as with the mean (Fig. 6c, middle) and
maximal (data not shown) duration of NREM sleep episodes (P ¼
0.002 and P ¼ 0.0008, respectively), and negatively correlated with the
number of NREM sleep episodes (P ¼ 0.006; Fig. 6c, right). In contrast,
we did not find any correlation between the decline in slope and the
amount of REM sleep (r ¼ 0.17, P ¼ 0.31) or theta (6–9 Hz) power in
REM sleep (r ¼ –0.20, P ¼ 0.21; Supplementary Fig. 7 online).
Computer simulations also predicted that a decrease in net synaptic
strength in cortical circuits should be reflected in a decrease in the slope
of spontaneous sleep slow waves (as opposed to the slope of evoked
responses)36 between early and late sleep. Experiments in both rats39
and humans40 have confirmed these predictions and have shown that
the decline in slow-wave slope is evident even when wave amplitude
does not change. We therefore examined the relationship between the
decline in the slope of evoked LFPs (collected in quiet wakefulness) and
changes in the slope of spontaneous sleep slow waves. We found a

other words, there should be evidence for partial occlusion of LTP after
prolonged wakefulness. In contrast, after sleep, LTP-induction should
be facilitated. To test this prediction, an additional group of rats (n ¼ 7)
were implanted, handled and recorded as before. The animals then
received high-frequency electrical stimulation in the frontal motor
cortex to induce LTP using an established protocol42. Each rat was
subjected to the LTP-inducing protocol twice, at light onset and after
4 h of sleep, always in a standardized state of quiet wakefulness. At light
onset, after several hours of wakefulness, no consistent change in the
LFP slope was elicited (Fig. 7a). In contrast, LTP could easily be
induced after a period of sleep (Fig. 7a) and persisted for at least 1 h
(Fig. 7b). These results suggest that the induction of LTP is partially
occluded after a period of wakefulness and restored after sleep.
DISCUSSION
The present results provide both molecular and electrophysiological
evidence that periods of wakefulness are associated with a net increase
in cortical synaptic strength and periods of sleep are associated with a
net decrease. At the molecular level, GluR1-containing AMPAR levels
in synaptoneurosomes were high during waking and low during sleep
in both cortex and hippocampus. Changes in AMPAR, CamKII and
GSK3b phosphorylation were also consistent with synaptic potentiation during wakefulness and with depression during sleep. Moreover,
an electrophysiological marker of synaptic efficacy, the slope of cortical
evoked responses, increased after wakefulness and decreased after sleep.
Molecular and electrophysiological indicators of synaptic strength
changed in a similar manner after spontaneous wakefulness during
the night and after enforced wakefulness during the day, suggesting that
the underlying processes are largely independent of time of day, but
depend instead on the sleep-waking history of the animal. Finally,
consistent with a net increase in synaptic strength during wakefulness,
LTP could easily be induced in animals after they had slept for several
hours, but not after they had remained awake for a similar period
of time.
By themselves, the observed molecular changes cannot prove conclusively that synaptic efficacy in vivo has changed, as molecular assays
do not necessarily reflect the functional state of synapses; for example,
synaptoneurosomes cannot distinguish between surface and internal
receptors, or between pre- and postsynaptic pools. Similarly, in vivo
field responses often include a polysynaptic component that is hard to
isolate. The electrophysiological changes observed in vivo might reflect
variations in factors besides synaptic strength that can affect neuronal
excitability, such as inhibition and neuromodulation. However, the
latter is unlikely to have a major role, as the slope did not change
substantially across different behavioral states, but decreased consistently in each behavioral state between high and low sleep pressure.
Altogether, alternative explanations that may not involve synaptic
plasticity cannot be ruled out, but at present it is difficult to envision
what other factors may offer an equally parsimonious account for our
findings. Indeed, the observed molecular and electrophysiological
changes support each other, offering complementary evidence, both
structural and functional, for opposite changes in net synaptic strength
between wakefulness and sleep. In the future, it will be essential to
confirm and extend these studies in slice preparations; for example, by
investigating pre- and postsynaptic changes as a function of prior sleep
and wake history through the measurements of the surface expression
of AMPARs and through the analysis of miniature synaptic potentials.
Moreover, given the major changes observed after a few hours of
wakefulness, it will be important to confirm and extend our initial
results suggesting that the induction of LTP in the cerebral cortex is
partially saturated after prolonged wakefulness and may be restored by

sleep. Notably, in vitro studies in the hippocampus have shown that
insufficient sleep impairs the induction of LTP, but favors the induction
of LTD (for example, see refs. 30,43–45). Finally, it will be important to
investigate whether NREM sleep, and specifically sleep slow waves, is
actively responsible for decreasing synaptic strength5,46 and to explore
the underlying mechanisms. In this respect, it is notable that we found
similar molecular changes in cortex and hippocampus, despite differences in sleep EEG activity and the lack of cellular slow oscillations in
many hippocampal cells47. Both hippocampal sharp wave-ripple events
and the membrane potential of hippocampal cells47 are strongly
modulated by the cortical slow oscillation48. Perhaps the occurrence
of high-frequency bursts of activity in the appropriate neuromodulatory milieu is sufficient to produce a net downscaling synaptic strength
in both structures41.
The molecular and electrophysiological changes reported here
occurred in freely behaving animals that had not been forced to engage
in specific learning tasks, suggesting that net plastic changes in opposite
directions accompany natural wakefulness and sleep5. On the other
hand, synaptic strength increased further when wakefulness was
extended by 4 h with exposure to novel objects, only to be restored to
a low level by the following period of sleep. Altogether, net cortical
synaptic strength appears to be homeostatically regulated in a way that is
similar to sleep pressure, which grows as a function of waking duration
and intensity and decreases with sleep29. Consistent with this observation, the slope of the evoked responses was positively correlated with the
level of the sleep SWA, a well-established marker of sleep pressure29.
The finding that wakefulness leads to a net potentiation of synaptic
strength and that sleep leads to a net depression, if confirmed in other
species and with different methodologies, has several implications. First,
it indicates that, despite the existence of mechanisms that could enforce
an ongoing homeostasis of plastic changes in a neuron49, the overall
balance of plasticity during wakefulness appears to lean toward potentiation. Indeed, there are indications that, in the awake adult
brain under physiological conditions, it is easier to induce LTP than
LTD8. Second, this finding implies that prolonged wakefulness may
pose an increasing burden on plastic circuits, consistent with theoretical and computational analyses suggesting that a progressive
strengthening of synapses with experience cannot continue indefinitely
because of constraints on energy, space, supplies and saturation of the
ability to learn4,5. Indeed, by triggering LTP-like mechanisms, learning
can strengthen synapses to near the maximum of their modification
range, impairing the further induction of LTP (for example, see
refs. 10,50). Third, these results suggest that sleep may help to maintain
synaptic homeostasis5; if wakefulness is associated with an increasing
burden to neurons imposed by progressively stronger synapses, then
sleep would be a good time to redress the balance. Indeed, a progressive
downscaling of synaptic strength may represent a key function of
NREM sleep, possibly through its characteristic firing patterns and
neuromodulatory changes41. We emphasize that the present results
cannot distinguish between a proportional renormalization of all
synapses and the depression of a majority of synapses coupled with
the preservation or even strengthening of select circuits, and they are
certainly compatible with the stabilization, consolidation and integration of memory traces7. In future work, it will be important to extend
these findings to other species, and to determine whether the likely
consequences of net changes of synaptic strength, such as metabolic
changes, show a similar relationship to preceding wakefulness and sleep.

the electrophysiological experiments were implanted in the frontal cortex with
bipolar concentric LFP electrodes for stimulation and chronic electroencephalographic recordings. Rats used for molecular studies were recorded using epidural
screw electrodes. Sleep stages were scored off-line by visual inspection of 4-s
epochs. All animal procedures followed the US National Institutes of Health
Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals and facilities were reviewed
and approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee of the
University of Wisconsin-Madison, and were inspected and accredited by the
Association for Assessment and Accreditation of Laboratory Animal Care.
Synaptoneurosome preparation and quantitative immunoblotting. The protocol was optimized according to suggestions from M.F. Bear and his
laboratory, and was essentially carried out as previously described10. Details
are provided in the Supplementary Methods.
LFP evoked responses. In all rats, LFP and EMG signals were continuously
recorded during a 24-h baseline period, sleep deprivation and recovery after
sleep deprivation. The collection of LFP-evoked responses occurred at B4-h
intervals, usually starting at around light onset (10 a.m.) of the baseline day,
and in some animals continued during sleep deprivation and the following 4 h
of recovery. Prior to the experiment, input-output tests were performed on
each rat. Details are provided in the Supplementary Methods. On completion
of the experiments, the position of the LFP electrodes was verified by histology
in all animals.
