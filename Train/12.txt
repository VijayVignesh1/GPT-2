Neurons in the neocortex exhibit spontaneous spiking activity in the
absence of external stimuli, but the origin and functions of this activity
remain uncertain. Here, we show that spontaneous spiking is also
prominent in a sensory paleocortex, the primary olfactory (piriform)
cortex of mice. In the absence of applied odors, piriform neurons
exhibit spontaneous firing at mean rates that vary systematically
among neuronal classes. This activity requires the participation of
NMDA receptors and is entirely driven by bottom-up spontaneous
input from the olfactory bulb. Odor stimulation produces two types of
spatially dispersed, odor-distinctive patterns of responses in piriform
cortex layer 2 principal cells: Approximately 15% of cells are excited by
odor, and another approximately 15% have their spontaneous activity
suppressed. Our results show that, by allowing odor-evoked suppression as well as excitation, the responsiveness of piriform neurons is at
least twofold less sparse than currently believed. Hence, by enabling
bidirectional changes in spiking around an elevated baseline, spontaneous activity in the piriform cortex extends the dynamic range of
odor representation and enriches the coding space for the representation of complex olfactory stimuli.

The brain remains intensely active even under conditions when
overt external stimuli are absent (1). At first glance this behavior can seem puzzling. Pyramidal neurons in primary sensory
neocortex, for example, typically fire spontaneously at approximately 1 Hz when the relevant stimuli are not present (2), raising
the possibility that this background activity is noise that must be
mitigated by signal averaging (3). On the other hand, spontaneous
cortical activity is often structured (4) and can reflect the global
state of the animal (5), suggesting that it is not simply an impediment but may serve a useful computational role. Indeed, such activity may be important for gating sensory inputs (4, 6), establishing
and maintaining sensory maps (7–9), and extending the dynamic
range of sensory-evoked responses (10, 11). The significance of
spontaneous activity is also supported by theoretical studies
showing that it emerges naturally from balanced neural networks
with desirable information-processing characteristics (9, 12).
Given that spontaneous spiking is likely to be a key element of
cortical function, it is important to study its prevalence and properties in different cortical areas. The piriform cortex (PC) is a
sensory paleocortex in mammals that is critical for recognizing and
remembering odors (13–17). The PC offers a number of advantages for the study of neural information processing, including a
simple trilaminar architecture and well-defined afferent input from
the olfactory bulb (OB) (16, 17). As a phylogenetically “old”
structure, the PC is also likely to express canonical cortical circuits
that have been conserved across evolution (18). Spontaneous
spiking has been reported in the PC of rodents breathing odor-free
air (19–23), but these studies used unit recordings, which provide a
biased estimate of firing rates (2), and none of them identified the
drivers or roles of this activity. Here we use two-photon calcium
imaging and whole-cell patch clamping from identified PC neurons
in vivo to measure the properties of stimulus-decoupled spiking.
We find that this ongoing spiking allows a broader dynamic range
of odor responsiveness, implying that the representation of odor
information in the PC is considerably less sparse than is currently
thought (20, 24).
Results
Spontaneous Spiking Occurs at Different Rates in Different Classes of
Piriform Neurons. Using mice, we imaged somatic intracellular
calcium (as a proxy for spiking) in layer 2 neurons of the anterior
PC while the animals breathed clean air. Layer 2 of the PC contains the densely packed somas of glutamatergic cells of different
types (Fig. S1A). The more superficial lamina (layer 2a) is enriched
in semilunar (SL) cells, whereas the deeper lamina (layer 2b)
mainly contains superficial pyramidal (SP) cells (Fig. S1A). Because SL and SP cells are likely to perform different functions in
the PC circuit (Fig. S1B) (25, 26), we took care to study them
separately by focusing on cells at different depths below the cortical
surface (160–210 μm for SL cells and 250–300 μm for SP cells).
Using the indicator Cal-520, we found that both SL and SP cells
exhibited ongoing spontaneous somatic calcium transients in the
absence of applied odors (Fig. 1A and Movie S1), and we obtained
similar results with the genetically encoded calcium indicator
GCaMP6f. Control experiments showed that these transients were
completely blocked by tetrodotoxin (TTX; 10 μM) applied to the
cortical surface (n = 3 animals), indicating that they are sodium
spike-driven. The transients occurred randomly, as was confirmed
by the exponential distribution of interevent time intervals (linear
fit to the logarithm of interval histogram; SL: r
2 = 0.98, n = 5 mice,
5,609 events in 725 cells; SP: r
2 = 0.98, n = 5 mice, 1,408 events in
275 cells).
To convert the calcium transient rate to an action potential
rate, we calibrated one of our indicators (Cal-520) by measuring
spontaneous calcium fluorescence transients in a single SL or SP
cell in vivo while simultaneously recording spikes in that cell via a
patch electrode (Fig. S2). Applying this calibration to our imaging
Significance
Sensory neurons are often spontaneously active even in the
absence of the relevant stimuli, raising the question, Is this
background activity a bug or a feature of neural circuits? Using
in vivo calcium imaging in mice, we show that neurons in the
primary olfactory (piriform) cortex are spontaneously active
when the animal is breathing unodorized air and this activity is
entirely driven by spontaneous firing in the upstream olfactory
bulb. When the animal smells an odor, some piriform neurons
fire more strongly, and others have their spontaneous activity
suppressed. By allowing two-way changes in firing, spontaneous background activity serves as a mechanism to extend
the range of odor coding.

dataset, we found that the mean spontaneous spike rate was significantly higher in SL cells than in SP cells (SL: 1.24 ± 0.04 Hz,
mean ± SEM, n = 7 mice, total 1,928 cells; SP: 0.74 ± 0.05 Hz, n =
6 mice, 1,005 cells; significantly different, P < 0.0001, Kolmogorov–Smirnov test) (Fig. 1B).
To confirm that the majority of cells imaged were indeed glutamatergic, we repeated these experiments using the red-shifted
calcium indicator Cal-590 in GAD67-GFP mice, in which
GABAergic interneurons express GFP (Fig. S3) (27). We confirmed that interneurons comprise a small fraction (approximately
4%) of layer 2 neurons in the PC, consistent with previous reports
(28). Thus, most of the neurons imaged in layer 2 are glutamatergic (SL and SP cells). Interestingly, GFP+ interneurons also
exhibited spontaneous spiking activity (Fig. S3 B and C).
In Vivo Patch-Clamp Experiments Confirm the Calcium Imaging Results.
To validate the findings from the calcium imaging, we turned to
in vivo whole-cell patch clamping. Spontaneous spiking was measured at the resting potential of each neuron while the animal
breathed odor-free air (Fig. 1C). These experiments confirmed that
the spontaneous spike rate was higher in the more superficial SL
cells (soma depth 160–230 μm, 1.7 ± 0.3 Hz, mean ± SEM, n = 28
cells) than in the deeper SP cells (230–300 μm, 0.7 ± 0.2 Hz, mean ±
SEM, n = 22 cells; P = 0.005, Mann–Whitney test). In addition, the
spontaneous spike rate was negatively correlated with recording
depth (P = 0.0006, n = 50 cells from 48 mice; F test on linear regression) (Fig. 1C, Inset). Thus, both patch clamping and imaging
show that SL and SP cells are spontaneously active, with a higher
spontaneous firing rate in SL cells than in SP cells.
Spontaneous Spiking Requires NMDA Receptors. Because the difficult surgical access to the PC precludes the use of awake animals,
we sought to validate our findings under different anesthetics.
Spontaneous spiking was similar under urethane and fentanyl/
medetomidine anesthesia [SL cells in fentanyl: 1.13 ± 0.05 Hz,
mean ± SEM, n = 2 mice, 612 cells; not significantly different
from corresponding control (urethane) values, P > 0.1, one-way
ANOVA with Tukey’s post hoc test; only SL cells were imaged in
fentanyl] (Fig. 2A). Fentanyl/medetomidine is thought to produce a more awake-like brain state (29). Surprisingly, spiking was
significantly reduced under ketamine/xylazine anesthesia (combined SL and SP data: 0.26 ± 0.04 Hz, mean ± SEM, n = 2 mice,
total 1,328 cells; significantly smaller than corresponding control
values, P < 0.0001, one-way ANOVA with Tukey’s post hoc test)
(Fig. 2A). This result may help explain why spontaneous activity
was not seen in the only previous in vivo calcium imaging study in
the PC, which used ketamine/xylazine (24).
Given that ketamine blocks NMDA channels, we asked
whether local application of the NMDA channel blocker MK801 (1 mM) to the PC would also suppress spontaneous spiking.
We found that it did so (SL: 0.05 ± 0.01 Hz, mean ± SEM, n = 3
mice, 1,728 cells; SP: 0.14 ± 0.01 Hz, n = 2 mice, 352 cells; both
significantly smaller than corresponding controls, P < 0.0001,
one-way ANOVA with Tukey’s post hoc test) (Fig. 2A). Thus,
spontaneous spiking in the PC depends critically on NMDA
receptor-mediated synaptic transmission.
Spontaneous Activity in the PC Is Driven Entirely by the OB. What
drives spontaneous spiking in the PC? Mechanosensitive effects
of nasal airflow across the olfactory epithelium (30) are not involved, because tracheotomizing mice to bypass the nasal airway
did not alter the activity (SL: 1.10 ± 0.06 Hz, mean ± SEM, n = 3
mice, 1,659 cells; SP: 0.77 ± 0.06 Hz, n = 3 mice, 406 cells; not
significantly different from corresponding controls, P > 0.1, oneway ANOVA with Tukey’s post hoc test) (Fig. 2A). However,
silencing the afferent input from the ipsilateral OB, either surgically or by locally applying TTX (10 μM) to the OB, reduced
spontaneous spiking in the PC (combined SL and SP data: 0.25 ±
0.05 Hz, mean ± SEM, n = 5 mice, 2,453 cells; significantly
smaller than control, P < 0.0001, one-way ANOVA with Tukey’s
post hoc test in Fig. 2A, Kolmogorov–Smirnov test in Fig. 2B).
Removal of both OBs abolished all activity in the PC (combined
SL and SP data: 0.01 ± 0.00 Hz, mean ± SEM, n = 3 mice, 2,162
cells; significantly smaller than control, P < 0.0001, one-way
ANOVA with Tukey’s post hoc test) (Fig. 2A). These data indicate that input from the OB is required for spontaneous
spiking activity in the PC.
Our findings suggest that the projection cells in the OB, the
mitral/tufted (M/T) cells, are spontaneously active in the absence
of applied odors. Imaging in the bulb confirmed this suggestion
(Fig. S4) (31). Interestingly, local application of TTX to the PC
had no effect on spontaneous spiking in M/T cells (n = 93 M/T
cells, P = 0.11, Kolmogorov–Smirnov test) (Fig. S4 B and C). This
result suggests that only OB → PC connections are important for
spontaneous spiking in the PC and that connections in the reverse
direction (PC → OB) are not involved (32–34).
Odors both Excite and Suppress Spontaneous Activity. How does this
spontaneous spiking activity influence the way exogenous odors
are detected by the PC? To address this question, we used twophoton calcium imaging to record the effect of prolonged (60-s)
steps of odorant on SL and SP cell activity. The responses were
heterogeneous: Some cells showed transient excitation at odor
onset, others were persistently activated throughout the odor application, and still others were suppressed (Fig. 3A using Cal-520

that the mean spontaneous spike rate in SL cells (n = 7 mice, 1,928 cells) and SP
cells (n = 6 mice, 1,005 cells; shaded regions are ± SEM) are significantly different (P < 0.0001, Kolmogorov–Smirnov test). (C) A typical in vivo whole-cell
recording showing spontaneous spiking in an SL cell (depth 166 μm). (Inset)
The spontaneous spike rate was higher in the more superficial SL cells (soma
depth 160–230 μm, 1.7 ± 0.3 Hz; mean ± SEM) than in the deeper SP cells (230–
300 μm, 0.7 ± 0.2 Hz; mean ± SEM, P = 0.005, Mann–Whitney test) and was
negatively correlated with recording depth (r = 0.47, P = 0.0006, n = 50 cells
from 48 mice; F test on linear regression).

and Movie S2 using GCaMP6f). The variety of responses in a
typical experiment is shown in Fig. 3B, which is a color raster plot
of activity in a sample of SL cells ordered by their activity in the
first 4 s after odor onset (filled circle in Fig. 3B). A gradient of
responsiveness is apparent, ranging from excitation (warm colors
just after odor onset; top) to inhibition (cool colors just after
onset; bottom), with a subset of cells showing no response (middle). Similar distinctions were seen at odor offset (open circle in
Fig. 3B).
These data were quantified by using a statistical criterion to
measure the percentage of cells either excited or suppressed at odor
onset or offset (Fig. S5). This analysis indicated that a similar
percentage of SL and SP cells was responsive to odor onset (SL:
34.1 ± 4.5% of cells, mean ± SEM, n = 10 imaging fields tested with
six odors; SP: 23.3 ± 2.3%, n = 8 fields and five odors; P = 0.063;
two-sample t test) (Fig. 3C). In contrast, fewer SP cells responded at
odor offset (SL: 35.6 ± 3.0%, mean ± SEM; SP: 16.1 ± 1.6%; P <
0.0001; two-sample t test) (Fig. 3C). Similar results were obtained if
excitation and suppression were considered separately (Fig. S6A)
and if the odor concentration was varied over two orders of magnitude (Fig. S6 B and C). Furthermore, we found no significant
differences between any of these measures when comparing responses to different odors (one-way ANOVA, all P > 0.05). In
summary, spontaneous activity allows odor-driven bidirectional
changes in spiking around an elevated baseline. Although there are
some differences between SL and SP cells, the percentage of responsive cells is independent of odor identity and concentration.
Balanced Excitation and Suppression. Given that odors both excite
and suppress firing in PC neurons, we wondered if the net effect
was to keep firing in equilibrium. Indeed, when averaged across all
SL cells or all SP cells in our dataset, the mean spike rate during
the odor was not significantly different from that in unodorized air,
except at odor onset and offset (Fig. S7). Thus, following a perturbation of the olfactory stimulus, excitation and suppression are
quickly balanced to keep the net population activity constant (35).
Relationship Between Spontaneous Firing Rate and Odor Responsiveness.
We next asked whether cells with a higher spontaneous firing rate
also exhibited a stronger odor response, given that both types of
activity are driven by bulbar input. We tested this notion by plotting
the peak odor-evoked ΔF/F0 in each odor-responsive cell versus the
mean spontaneous rate for that cell (Fig. 4A). SP cells exhibited a
significant correlation, but SL cells did not (SL: P = 0.20, n = 321
cells; SP: P < 0.001, n = 83 cells; F test on linear regression). Thus,
in SP cells the input that drives odor responsiveness is closely related to the input that drives spontaneous activity, but this association is absent in SL cells.
Excited and Suppressed Neurons Form Spatially Dispersed, Odor-Distinctive
Patterns. As noted above (Fig. 3C and Fig. S6), different odors could
not be distinguished by the mean responsiveness of SL or SP cells
(i.e., the fraction of cells excited or suppressed). On the other hand, it
is known that different odors produce distinctive, spatially dispersed
patterns of excited principal neurons in the PC (red somas, Fig. 4B)
(20, 24); these patterns are thought to form the basis of odor identification by the PC (15–17). We found a similar effect for suppression: Odors also produced distinctive, spatially dispersed patterns of
suppression of SL and SP cells at both odor onset and offset (blue
somas in Fig. 4B; similar results were obtained in 10 experiments).
We quantified this effect by calculating, separately for excitation and
suppression, the mean distance between each odor-responsive neuron
in the imaged field and its five nearest odor-responsive neighbors.
These mean distances then were averaged across all odor-excited or
odor-suppressed neurons in each imaging experiment (red and blue
points, respectively, in Fig. 4C). The mean distance between odorexcited and odor-suppressed neurons was not significantly different
across all experiments (SL: 60.3 ± 5.7 μm for excitation, 63.7 ±
7.7 μm for suppression, mean ± SEM, both n = 10 experiments, P =
0.73; SP: 116.1 ± 15.2 μm for excitation, n = 8, 98.5 ± 24.3 μm for
suppression, n = 5, P = 0.53; two-sample t test) (Fig. 4C). Similar
results were obtained when we measured the mean distance to all
(not just to the nearest five) odor-responsive neighbors in the imaged
field. We also asked if excited cells tended to be located near suppressed cells, or if the two types of cells were randomly intermingled
in a salt-and-pepper arrangement. An analysis similar to that described above confirmed the salt-and-pepper model (Fig. S8). Thus,
odors both excite and suppress layer 2 principal cells in a manner that
lacks any obvious spatial pattern.
Discussion
Spontaneous firing in the absence of overt input is commonly
observed in sensory neocortex, as well as in many other brain

regions, and its prevalence may suggest that it is a feature, not a
bug, of neural circuits (2–4). Here we confirm that spontaneous
firing is also a feature of a sensory paleocortex, the PC. We find
that spontaneous activity in the anterior PC strictly requires bottom-up input from the OB (Fig. 2A) and differs significantly between classes of principal cells (i.e., SL and SP cells) in its main
input layer, layer 2 (Figs. 1B, 2A, 3C, and 4A). Importantly, we also
find that spontaneous spiking activity increases the dynamic range
of odor representations in the anterior PC by defining a set point
around which odor stimulation can produce either excitation or
suppression of spiking activity (Fig. 3B). By expanding the definition of odor responsiveness in this way, we find that at least twice
as many layer 2 neurons respond to odors than previously thought;
i.e., approximately 25–35% respond at odor onset (Fig. 3C), rather
than the approximately 3–15% reported previously (24).
Before proceeding, we address two potential weaknesses of our
study. First, the use of anesthesia can be problematic (36), but it
was required in our experiments because of the invasive surgery
needed to access the surface of the PC (24). To address this issue,
we confirmed that two different anesthetics (urethane/chlorprothixene and fentanyl/medetomidine) gave identical results. Previous
work using unit recordings in awake mice has reported spontaneous
firing in layer 2 PC neurons at approximately 0.6–3.5 Hz (21),
compared with approximately 0.7–1.2 Hz here (Fig. 2A). Keeping
in mind that unit recordings are biased toward more active cells, we
believe that our results are in line with what occurs in awake animals. Given our finding that ketamine/xylazine inhibits spontaneous
activity (Fig. 2A), we recommend avoiding this anesthetic for PC
experiments (see also ref. 34).
A second potential concern is the use of calcium imaging as an
imperfect proxy for spikes. We mitigated this concern by using the
calcium indicators Cal-520 and GCaMP6f, which are at least 10-
fold more sensitive than Oregon Green BAPTA-1 (OGB-1) (37)
used in the one previous calcium imaging study in the PC (24). We
confirmed that OGB-1 could not detect spontaneous activity in
the PC (n = 7 imaging fields in two mice). Despite our improved
sensitivity, single spikes were not reliably detected in our imaging
experiments (Fig. S2), implying that the firing rate is underestimated. The patch-clamp experiments (Fig. 1C) were not subject to this limitation and confirmed the difference in the
spontaneous firing rate in SL and SP cells (Fig. 1B). Hence, imaging may underestimate absolute spike rates, but relative comparisons remain valid.
The higher spontaneous firing rate in SL cells is consistent
with previous reports that SL cells receive stronger afferent input
from the OB (25, 26), which we have shown here is the primary
driver of spontaneous activity. SP cells receive much stronger
associational input than SL cells, and some of this input comes
from the contralateral PC (25). However, removal of the ipsilateral OB almost completely abolished spontaneous activity
(Fig. 2A), implying that little spontaneous input comes via associational fibers from the contralateral PC. Another difference
between SL and SP cells is that only SP cells show a correlation
between spontaneous and odor-evoked activity (Fig. 4A). This
correlation may reflect the stronger associational connections
received by SP cells that might amplify, in parallel, the spontaneous and odor-evoked excitation received from the OB. A
functional consequence may be that SP cells, but not SL cells,
maintain a stable signal-to-noise ratio over a range of inputs (38).
We were surprised to find that spontaneous activity in the PC
was driven entirely by feed-forward excitation from the OB (Fig.
2A, both OBs removed). The anterior PC is the recipient of
excitatory input from a number of other brain areas, including
the anterior olfactory nucleus, orbitofrontal cortex, entorhinal
cortex, and amygdala (39, 40), but we found no sign of residual
spontaneous drive after OB removal. However, it remains possible that intracortical and descending inputs could contribute to
spontaneous activity in the awake state. The anterior PC also
sends corticobulbar axons back to the OB (32, 33, 41), but, again,
we found no evidence for the contribution of a reciprocal OB ↔ PC

loop in the generation of spontaneous excitation in the PC (Fig.
S4). Two recent reports have described spontaneous calcium
transients in boutons on corticobulbar axons in the OB (33, 34).
Their presence implies that the sources of those axons, SP cells
in the anterior PC (42), are also spontaneously active, consistent
with our findings.
Turning to odor-evoked responses, we observed a heterogeneity
of response patterns (Fig. 3 and Fig. S5). However, when averaging
across all imaged neurons in all experiments, the mean spike rate
increased only at odor onset and offset, suggesting that global excitation and suppression are normally balanced in an unchanging
olfactory environment (Fig. S7). These properties are suited to a
mechanism enabling animals to follow odor plumes or scent trails
(43). Gradients in odor concentration at the edges of the plume
may be efficiently encoded by “on” and “off” responses, whereas a
more stable concentration within the plume may be represented by
the neurons that exhibit persistent excitation or suppression. Interestingly, a similar diversity of odor-evoked responses was recently reported in the lateral entorhinal cortex (44), suggesting that
it may be a general feature of odor-processing circuits.
How might the enhancement or suppression of spontaneous
spiking be incorporated into a mechanism for encoding odors?
As in other cortical regions, the rate of spontaneous spiking in
the PC is low, approximately 1 Hz (Fig. 1B). However, the PC is
thought to use a rate code (22, 45) and is able to identify odors
quickly (46). Thus, if changes in the low rate of spontaneous
firing are to represent information on a fast timescale, the PC or
higher areas need to compute averaged firing rates across many
neurons simultaneously. This computation must be achieved
without erasing information about odor identity that is thought
to be encoded in the spatially distinctive patterns of activity
elicited by different odors (Fig. 4B). How this task might be
implemented (47, 48) is an intriguing question for future work.
In summary, we have found that spontaneous activity in the
anterior PC is inherited from the OB, differs between types of
principal cells, and can be suppressed by odors. Our results
suggest that spontaneous spiking can extend the dynamic range
of odor representations in the PC, enhancing the ability of this
sensory paleocortex to encode complex olfactory information.
Materials and Methods
Animals and Anesthesia. All procedures involving mice were approved by the
Animal Experimentation Ethics Committee of the Australian National University
and conform to the guidelines of the National Health and Medical Research
Council of Australia. Experiments used male or female, 50- to 70-d-old C57BL6/J
mice. Mice were anesthetized with urethane + chlorprothixene (0.7 g/kg s.c. and
5 mg/kg s.c., respectively), ketamine + xylazine (100 mg/kg and 10 mg/kg, respectively), or fentanyl + medetomidine (0.1 mg/kg and 1 mg/kg, respectively).
Surgery. To access the anterior PC, overlying muscle and bone were sequentially dissected, and then a craniotomy (approximately 1.5 × 1.5 mm)
was opened over the region where the middle cerebral artery (MCA) and the
dorsal aspect of the lateral olfactory tract (LOT) intersect. The dura was removed also. A water-tight chamber was constructed around the surgical site
to accommodate the water-immersion objective. The chamber was filled
with Ringer’s solution containing (in mM) 135 NaCl, 5.4 KCl, 1.8 CaCl2,
1 MgCl2, 5 Hepes at pH 7.4, and drugs were applied by perfusing this chamber.
Calcium Indicators. We used three types of calcium indicators in this study: the
green dye Cal-520 AM, its red-shifted variant Cal-590 AM, and the green
genetically encoded calcium indicator GCaMP6f. Cal-520 AM or Cal-590 AM
(1 mM; AAT Bioquest) was pressure-injected into the PC at a depth of 200–
300 μm with a micropipette. Sulforhodamine (SR) 101 (50 μM) was added to
the Cal-520 solution to label astrocytes. Calcium imaging was performed at
least 30 min after dye loading. For imaging with GCaMP6f, virus (AAV1.Syn.
Flex.GCaMP6f.WPRE.SV40 + AAV1.hSyn.Cre.WPRE.hGH, from the University
of Pennsylvania Vector Core) was stereotaxically injected into the PC or OB in
mice anesthetized with isoflurane. Imaging was performed 2–3 wk later.
Two-Photon Imaging. Imaging was done using a customized Thorlabs twophoton microscope with a 16× water-immersion objective (0.8 NA; Nikon),
resonant galvanometer scanners, and a Ti:Sapphire laser (Chameleon Ultra;
Coherent). Time-series movies were captured at 30 or 60 frames/s.
Odor Stimulation. To measure spontaneous activity, a constant flow (0.5 L/min) of
charcoal-filtered and humidified medical-grade air was delivered to the nares
of the mouse. Odor stimulation used a custom-built 16-channel flow dilution
Fig. 4. Properties of odor-evoked excitation and suppression. (A) Each point shows the peak odor-evoked response in an odor-excited neuron plotted versus
the mean spontaneous spike rate measured in the same neuron. Different colors indicate different odors. Superimposed straight lines indicate a correlation
for SP cells (slope = 0.25, correlation coefficient = 0.48, n = 83 cells) but not for SL cells (slope = 0.02, correlation coefficient = 0.07, n = 321 cells). (B, Left)
Imaged field of SL cells with somatic ROIs outlined. The other three panels show the same ROIs with color-coded odor responses to the three odors indicated.
The indicator was GCaMP6f. (C) Each red point indicates the mean distance between each excited cell in an imaged field and its five nearest neighbors that
also were excited, averaged across all excited cells in that field. Blue points show the same measure for suppressed cells. Lines connect data from the same
experiment (n = 10 experiments for SL cells, n = 8 experiments for SP cells). In three SP cell experiments (red points without connected blue points) there were
fewer than six suppressed cells in the imaged field. ns, not significant (P > 0.5, unpaired two-tailed t test).

olfactometer to deliver odorized air into the clean air stream. The performance of
the olfactometer was confirmed using a photo-ionization detector (miniPID;
Aurora Scientific) (Fig. S6B).
Whole-Cell Recordings. Blind whole-cell current clamp recordings were
obtained from layer 2 neurons using a patch pipette (5–7 MΩ) filled with an
intracellular solution containing (in mM) 135 KMeSO4, 7 NaCl, 2 MgCl2,
0.1 EGTA, 2 Na2-ATP, 0.3 Na3-GTP, 10 Hepes, adjusted to pH 7.2 with KOH
and an osmolarity of 290 mOsm/kg.
Analysis. Analysis was done with ImageJ and custom MATLAB code (MathWorks). The raw fluorescence intensity of each region of interest (ROI) was
calculated and expressed as ΔF/F0 = (F − F0)/F0, where F0 is the median of the
lower 80% of values during the clean air period. Transients in the ΔF/F0 trace
were detected using a sliding template (49). Excitation and suppression were
determined using a bootstrapping procedure to determine appropriate
thresholds. False-positive rates were estimated to be <1.7%.

and Methods.
