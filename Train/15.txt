The homeostatic control of body temperature is essential for survival
in mammals and is known to be regulated in part by temperaturesensitive neurons in the hypothalamus. However, the specific neural
pathways and corresponding neural populations have not been fully
elucidated. To identify these pathways, we used cFos staining to
identify neurons that are activated by a thermal challenge and found
induced expression in subsets of neurons within the ventral part of the
lateral preoptic nucleus (vLPO) and the dorsal part of the dorsomedial
hypothalamus (DMD). Activation of GABAergic neurons in the vLPO
using optogenetics reduced body temperature, along with a decrease
in physical activity. Optogenetic inhibition of these neurons resulted in
fever-level hyperthermia. These GABAergic neurons project from the
vLPO to the DMD and optogenetic stimulation of the nerve terminals
in the DMD also reduced body temperature and activity. Electrophysiological recording revealed that the vLPO GABAergic neurons suppressed neural activity in DMD neurons, and fiber photometry of
calcium transients revealed that DMD neurons were activated by cold.
Accordingly, activation of DMD neurons using designer receptors
exclusively activated by designer drugs (DREADDs) or optogenetics
increased body temperature with a strong increase in energy expenditure and activity. Finally, optogenetic inhibition of DMD neurons
triggered hypothermia, similar to stimulation of the GABAergic neurons in the vLPO. Thus, vLPO GABAergic neurons suppressed the thermogenic effect of DMD neurons. In aggregate, our data identify
vLPO→DMD neural pathways that reduce core temperature in response to a thermal challenge, and we show that outputs from the
DMD can induce activity-induced thermogenesis.
thermoregulation | preoptic area | dorsomedial hypothalamus |
fiber photometry | energy expenditure
Adult mammals, including humans, precisely maintain core
body temperature (Tcore) within a narrow range. This system
is essential for survival because a significant deviation of Tcore
can adversely affect cellular metabolism. Changes in environmental temperature activate homeostatic responses that, in turn,
regulate energy expenditure, adaptive thermogenesis, and physical activity in an attempt to maintain near-optimal Tcore. Previous studies have shown that the preoptic area (POA) of the
hypothalamus plays an important role in maintaining a stable
Tcore via afferent inputs from skin thermoreceptors. The direct
sensing of changes in skin temperature, in turn, activates POA
efferent signals that control thermal effector organs (1, 2). For
example, in response to a heat stress, warmth receptors within
the dorsal root ganglion provide excitatory input to POA neurons via relay neurons in the dorsal lateral parabrachial nucleus
(3). In addition, recordings from in vivo models and in slice preparations identify a group of intrinsic warm-sensitive neurons
(WSNs) (20–40%) that may enable animals to directly detect brain
warmth and promote heat loss (4). Thermosensitive transient receptor potential channel M2 (TRPM2), which is expressed in the
POA, may be part of the heat sensor in WSNs that can limit fever
and induce hypothermia (5). Furthermore, activation of glutamatergic neurons in several POA subareas results in severe hypothermia, whereas activation of subsets of POA GABAergic neurons
has been found to have only a minimal or no effect on Tcore (5, 6).
However, the precise nature of the POA projections that play a role
in suppressing thermogenesis have not been elucidated. Thus, although several relevant brain regions have been suggested to act
in concert with the POA to regulate Tcore (1, 2), including the dorsomedial hypothalamus (DMH), the periventricular nucleus, and
the raphe pallidus nucleus, functional connections between the
POA and other thermoregulatory regions are largely unknown.
In the present study, we began by defining sites in which cFos
staining was induced by changes in environmental temperature.
These studies identified temperature-activated neurons in the
ventral part of the lateral preoptic nucleus (vLPO) and the
dorsal part of the DMH (DMD). We confirmed that DMD
neurons responded to cold by using fiber photometry, and tested
the ability of these and POA neurons to affect Tcore, energy
expenditure (EE), and physical activity by using optogenetics (7)
or designer receptors exclusively activated by designer drugs
(DREADDs) (8). These functional studies identified neural
pathways in which heat-activated GABAergic neurons in the
vLPO inhibit cold-activated neurons in the DMD to suppress
thermogenesis and lower Tcore.
Results
Activation of GABAergic POA Neurons Is Sufficient To Drive Hypothermia.
The POA is known to receive input from cold- and heat-sensitive
neurons (1). However, although recent data have identified some of
the neural substrates for temperature sensing (5, 6), components of
the neural circuit(s) that respond to thermal challenges have not been
Significance
Thermal homeostasis is essential for survival in mammals. Although it is known that temperature-sensitive neurons in the
hypothalamus can control body temperature, the precise neural types and dynamics of neurons responding to changes in
environmental temperature are not well defined. In this study,
we identified subsets of temperature-activated neurons in two
hypothalamic nuclei, the preoptic area (POA) and the dorsomedial hypothalamus (DMH), and showed that modulating
their activity can lead to alterations in core temperature. The
data further suggest that heat-activated GABAergic neurons in
the POA reduce the activity of cold-activated neurons in the
DMH, which function to increase thermogenesis and physical
activity. These data identify a neural circuit that controls core
temperature and thermogenesis.

fully elucidated. For example, there are conflicting data concerning
the potential role of GABAergic neurons in the POA (2, 5, 6). To
identify these key neural populations, we characterized the pattern of
cFos activation following a thermal challenge (SI Appendix, Fig. S1).
We found heat-induced cFos expression in the medial preoptic area
(MPO) and the vLPO, and it colocalized with the GABAergic marker
GAD67 (Fig. 1A and SI Appendix, Fig. S5A). Both the MPO and the
vLPO have been suggested to play important roles in thermoregulation (1, 2, 9–11). To test the function of the vLPO neuronal population, we targeted expression of channelrhodopsin-2 (ChR2) fused
with eYFP to GABAergic neurons within the vLPO by injecting Credependent adeno-associated virus (AAV) 5 viruses into the vLPO of
Vgat-IRES-Cre driver mice (Vgat stands for vesicular GABA transporter) (Fig. 1B). In slice recordings, we confirmed that the delivery of
blue light to ChR2-expressing vLPOVgat neurons resulted in neural
excitation (Fig. 1C). In vivo, we found that light-induced activation of
vLPOVgat neurons triggered a rapid reduction in Tcore with a decrease
in physical activity (ΔT = –1.8 ± 0.09 °C at t = 30 min, mean ± SEM,
Fig. 1 D and E) in freely behaving mice. This effect was specific to
ChR2, because injection of control AAV5 viruses (expressing eYFP)
did not significantly affect Tcore or activity.
Next, we asked whether inhibiting these neurons was sufficient
to drive hyperthermia. Using the Guillardia theta anion channelrhodopsin 1 (hGtACR1), which robustly silences neural activity in response to blue-yellow light (12), we found that blue
light delivery was sufficient to silence neurons in slice recordings
(Fig. 1C). Remarkably, light stimulation of mice expressing
hGtACR1 in vLPOVgat neurons caused severe hyperthermia with
elevated activity levels (maximal Tcore = 40.6 °C, Fig. 1 D and E).
Indeed, we needed to minimize the time in which animals received light illumination to prevent hyperthermia-induced death.
We also tested the function of MPO GABAergic neurons by
targeted expressing of ChR2 to GABAergic neurons within the
MPO of Vgat-IRES-Cre driver mice (SI Appendix, Fig. S5B).
The GABAergic neurons in the MPO have been suggested to
play important roles in thermoregulation (1, 2). Surprisingly, we
found that optogenetic activation of these MPOVgat neurons did
not significantly affect Tcore or activity (SI Appendix, Fig. S5 C
and D). Similar to our results, DREADD activation of these
neurons has a minimal effect on Tcore (5).
Thus, our results establish that activation of GABAergic neurons
within a preoptic subregion (vLPO) can inhibit thermogenesis,
whereas inhibition of these neurons dramatically raises core temperature. We next explored the functional targets of these neurons.
Critical Role of the POA→DMD Connection in Reducing Tcore. We
thought that vLPOVgat neurons might project to the DMH because
the DMH is known to participate in thermoregulation, and because
we observed that thermal stimuli induced strong cFos staining within
the DMD (SI Appendix, Fig. S1). To test whether vLPOVgat neurons directly innervate DMD neurons, we first performed anterograde tracing from these neurons by injecting ChR2 into vLPOVgat
neurons (Fig. 2A) and found staining of nerve terminals in the
DMD (Fig. 2B). We then performed retrograde labeling by injecting
the retrograde protein, cholera toxin B subunit (CTb; ref. 13) into
the DMD and found it labeled many neurons in the POA, including heat-activated neurons (as indicated by induction of cFos)
in the vLPO (Fig. 2C).
We tested the function of this vLPO→DMD projection by
stimulating vLPOVgat terminals in the DMD after viral injection of
ChR2 into the vLPO (Fig. 2D). We found that stimulation with blue
light triggered a significant reduction of Tcore (ΔT = –2.3 ± 0.6 °C at
t = 60 min, mean ± SEM, Fig. 2E) along with a decrease in activity
(Fig. 2F). The magnitude of the effect was similar to that observed
after direct stimulation of Vgat neurons in the vLPO. Thus, stimulation of vLPOVgat nerve terminals in the DMD recapitulated the
phenotype observed when vLPOVgat cell bodies were stimulated
(Fig. 1 D and E, Upper).
These functional data suggest that vLPOVgat neurons inhibit
DMD neurons and reduce core temperature and thermogenesis.
We next set out to confirm this inhibition directly by recording
inhibitory postsynaptic currents (IPSCs) in DMD neurons after
vLPOVgat terminals were stimulated. This recording is important
because our data could also be explained by inhibition of axon
fibers that pass through the DMD without directly innervating
DMD neurons. In slice preparations, we confirmed that stimulation of vLPOVgat terminals expressing ChR2 by blue lightinduced IPSCs in the DMD neurons and that these currents were
blocked by a GABAA receptor antagonist, bicuculline (Fig. 2G).
The onset of these currents was <3 ms after light delivery, which
is within the time range of monosynaptic transmission (14). Furthermore, to identify which types of DMD neurons are synaptically
connected to the vLPOVgat neurons, we used the recording pipette
to isolate mRNA from individual, light-responsive DMD neurons
immediately after recordings and analyzed gene expression by
single-cell reverse transcription PCR (RT-PCR) (15). These singlecell RT-PCR data showed that there were both Vgat+ and Vglut2+
postsynaptic neurons in the DMD, with the majority being Vgat+
(Fig. 2H and SI Appendix, Fig. S6).
Several reports (16–21) have suggested that DMD neurons
can regulate thermogenesis, but the inputs to these neurons have
not been elucidated. Our studies in anterograde and retrograde

tracing, optogenetic activation of terminals from vLPOVgat
neurons in the DMD, slice recordings, and single-cell RT-PCR
suggest the possibility that there are functional connections between the vLPOVgat neurons and DMDVgat or DMDVglut2 neurons
to regulate core temperature. We next tested these connections
directly by monitoring and modulating the activity of neurons in
the DMD.
Fiber Photometry Reveals That DMD Neurons Are Cold Activated. The
observation that inhibitory neurons that project to the DMD
cause hypothermia suggests that neurons within the DMD may
be cold sensitive (via either direct or indirect inputs) and act to
raise core temperature (which would explain why inhibiting their
inhibitors would raise Tcore; Fig. 1D). We first tested this hypothesis by using the calcium reporter GCaMP6f (22) to directly
measure neural Ca2+ signals by fiber photometry after changes
in environmental temperature. Similar experimental setups
have yielded stable recordings from the dorsal raphe (23) (Fig.
3A). We recorded Ca2+ signals from both glutamatergic
(DMDVglut2) and GABAergic (DMDVgat) neurons separately by
injecting a Cre-dependent version of GCaMP6f into Vglut2-
IRES-Cre and Vgat-IRES-Cre mice, respectively (Fig. 3B). We
controlled floor temperature (Tfloor) of mice with a Peltier controller
(Fig. 3C). The DMDVglut2 neurons showed significant Ca2+ signals
in response to cooling (25–13 °C, maximal response, ΔF/F0_max =
16.5 ± 2.6%, mean ± SEM; Fig. 3D, Left), but not to warming (25–
38 °C, Fig. 3D, Center). The responses occurred within seconds of the
temperature shift and diminished quickly in cold. Approximately 2 min
following the temperature shift (t = 110–120 s), mean neuronal activity
levels (ΔF/F0 (110–120 s)) were not higher than baseline (Fig. 3D, Right).
We also observed an even larger Ca2+ increases in response to
cooling in DMDVgat neurons (25–13 °C) (ΔF/F0_max = 22.7 ± 2.8%,
mean ± SEM; Fig. 3E, Left). This Ca2+ signal increased rapidly
(within seconds) after the temperature shift and diminished more
slowly than in DMDVglut2 neurons. ΔF/F0(110–120s) was significantly
larger than baselines (Fig. 3E, Right). We fitted the response curve
by using a sigmoidal function and found the full width at half
maximum (FWFM or T1/2 max) of the DMDVgat neurons was longer
than that of DMDVglut2 neurons (T1/2 max = 22.6 s and 16.5 s, respectively; SI Appendix, Fig. S8 A and B).
Taken together, these results indicate that both GABAergic
and glutamatergic neurons in the DMD are activated by cooling.
The response of DMDVgat neurons lasted longer than that
of DMDVglut2 neurons. All of our temperature stimuli-evoked
calcium responses appeared to result from periphery sensory input,
rather than from a slow change in body temperature, based on

the fast-rising kinetics. The calcium responses occurred within
seconds after the temperature shift (Fig. 3 D and E), whereas the
changes in Tcore happened minutes after the temperature shift
(SI Appendix, Fig. S2).
DMD Neurons Promote Thermogenesis. The finding that cooling
leads to abrupt Ca2+ transients in DMDVglut2 neurons suggests
that these neurons might play a functional role in cold-induced
thermogenesis. We next tested this by using DREADDs to
activate DMDVglut2 neurons remotely, allowing us to measure
energy expenditure (EE) without being impeded by optical
fibers required for optogenetics. As predicted, we found that
injection of the ligand clozapine N-oxide (CNO) into mice
expressing designed human M3 muscarinic receptor coupled to Gq
(hM3D) (8) in DMDVglut2 neurons strongly increased Tcore, along
with an increase in EE and physical activity (ΔT = 1.4 ± 0.3 °C,
ΔEE = 47.3 ± 5.1% at t = 100 min, mean ± SEM; Fig. 4 A–D). These
increases are direct evidence that activation of DMDVglut2 neurons
promotes thermogenesis, which is consistent with previous studies
showing that the DMD may send excitatory (or glutamatergic) projections to promote cold- or febrile-induced thermogenesis (16, 17,
24, 25).
The findings that cooling induced calcium transients in
DMDVgat neurons (Fig. 3E) and that cold-induced cFos colocalized with GAD67 in the DMD (SI Appendix, Fig. S7A) suggest
that these neurons could also be important for regulating coldinduced thermogenesis. We tested this by using both DREADDs
and optogenetics to activate DMDVgat neurons. We found that
injection of CNO, but not saline, into mice expressing h3MD
in DMDVgat neurons resulted in a slow, yet long-lasting increase
in Tcore, with an increase in EE and activity (ΔT = 1.3 ± 0.2 °C,
ΔEE = 47.4 ± 7.5% at t = 100 min, mean ± SEM; Fig. 4 E–H).
We fitted the response curve with a sigmoidal function and calculated maximum change rate (k) and full width at half maximum
(FWFM) (SI Appendix, Fig. S8 C and D). For the same dose of
CNO, the k for the Tcore, EE, and activity response curves were
smaller for DMDVgat neural activation than was observed after
DMDVglut2 neural activation. However, the FWFWs were longer
after DMDVgat neural activation versus activation of DMDVglut2 (SI
Appendix, Fig. S8 C and D). The kinetics of these biological responses matched that seen by recording from these neurons,
which indicates that cold-induced Ca2+ transients of DMDVgat
neurons diminished more slowly than that of DMDVglut2 neurons
(Fig. 3 D and E and SI Appendix, Fig. S8 A and B). Also, we
observed an increase in Tcore and activity after optogenetic
stimulation of mice expressing ChR2 in DMDVgat neurons (SI
Appendix, Fig. S8 B–D). In aggregate, these data show that activation of both glutamatergic and GABAergic neurons in the
DMD can increase Tcore, EE, and activity, although the kinetics
of the biological responses to activation of these neurons were
different.
Inhibition of DMD Neurons Is Sufficient To Drive Hypothermia. The
finding that vLPOVgat inputs to the DMD lower core temperature led us to predict that optogenetic inhibition of DMD neurons would have a similar effect. This prediction was tested by
injecting AAV9 viruses expressing hGtACR1 into the DMD of
Vglut2-IRES-Cre or Vgat-IRES-Cre driver mice (thereby driving
hGtACR1 expression in DMDVglut2 or DMDVgat neurons, respectively). We found that blue light stimulation of mice expressing
hGtACR1 in DMDVglut2 neurons resulted in a significant reduction
in Tcore, along with a decrease in activity (ΔT = –1.3 ± 0.2 °C at t =
60 min, mean ± SEM; Fig. 5 A and B), similar to optogenetic
activation of the vLPOVgat neurons (Fig. 1 D and E). Similarly,
blue light stimulation of mice expressing hGtACR1 in DMDVgat
neurons resulted in significant reductions in Tcore, along with a
decrease in activity (ΔT = –2.5 ± 0.5 °C at t = 60 min, mean ± SEM;
Fig. 5 C and D). Taken together, these results define elements of a
POA→DMH neural circuit in the hypothalamus (including
vLPOVgat→DMDVglut2 and vLPOVgat→DMDVgat connections) that
regulate thermogenesis.
Discussion
The maintenance of a stable core temperature is essential for
survival. Our study elucidates a central mechanism through
which changes in core temperature (in response to alternations
in ambient temperature or other stimuli) elicit a set of adaptive
thermogenic responses that defend Tcore. In aggregate, we find
that in response to a heat challenge, heat-activated GABAergic
neurons in the vLPO directly inhibit the activity of cold-activated
glutamatergic and GABAergic neurons in the DMD to lower
Tcore, and do so (in part) by suppressing EE and activity. Thus,
we have elucidated pathways for controlling body temperature
and activity-induced thermogenesis.
In connection with our study, previous studies have suggested
that the vLPO is an important site for thermoregulation. Local
warming of the vLPO causes paw vasodilation in rats (9), suggesting the existence of WSNs in this area that can drive hypothermia. Also, the vLPO is labeled when a retrograde tracer
(pseudo rabies virus) is injected into the interscapular brown
adipose tissue (BAT) of rats (26), suggesting its involvement in
controlling BAT thermogenesis. Interestingly, a recent study
discovered that a heat-sensitive channel, TRPM2, in the POA
(including the vLPO) may be part of the WSN heat sensor to
limit fever (5). Thus, it will be interesting to see whether TRPM2
is important for vLPO neurons to detect brain warmth and
lower Tcore.
We found that heat activated a subset of GABAergic neurons in
the vLPO, which then lowered Tcore. Although a similar (or
stronger) effect was observed after activation of glutamatergic
neurons in several preoptic subregions [MPA (6), and MPO (5)],
activation of GABAergic neurons in these areas has a small effect
on Tcore, and the role of GABAergic neurons in the vLPO was not
studied previously. We found that activation of GABAergic neurons in the vLPO is sufficient to induce hypothermia (Fig. 1 B and
D). However, this activation does not include the ventrolateral
preoptic nucleus (VLPO), which is important for sleep regulation
(27, 28) but may be dispensable for thermoregulation, because its
lesion has a minimal effect on Tcore (27). The vLPO GABAergic
neurons comprise a functionally confirmed GABAergic population in the POA. In addition, we found that inhibiting vLPO
GABAergic neurons induced fever-level hyperthermia, suggesting
that these neurons can control Tcore in either direction (Fig. 1D),
and that these neurons provide a key entry point for studying the
neural mechanisms controlling thermogenesis. Furthermore, we
found heat can also activate a subset of glutamatergic neurons in
the vLPO, which can drive severe hypothermia and hypoactivity (SI

Appendix, Fig. S3). Thus, vLPO GABAergic neurons might receive local inputs from vLPO glutamatergic neurons or other
preoptic glutamatergic neurons as proposed (1, 2) (such as the
MnPO, because the MnPO receives inputs from the periphery (3) and sends glutamatergic outputs specifically to the
vLPO; SI Appendix, Fig. S4). These inputs must be functionally
confirmed.
In addition to the POA, the DMH is also an important site for
thermoregulation. Although a POA→DMH connection has been
proposed to play a role in thermoregulation (1, 2), direct functional confirmation of this connection is lacking. For example,
pioneering studies suggest that there are anatomical connections
between DMH neurons and MnPO or MPO neurons, and DMH
thermogenic neurons are differentially regulated by GABAergic
and glutamatergic inputs (18, 24, 25). However, it is equally likely
for these inputs to arise from preoptic subregions (such as the
MnPO or MPO) vs. other brain regions. In addition, activation of
GABAergic neurons in subregions including the MnPO and MPO
have a small effect on Tcore (refs. 5 and 6 and SI Appendix, Fig. S5).
We thus wondered whether vLPOVgat neurons innervate DMD
neurons and reduced Tcore in response to heat by inhibiting
DMD neurons. To test this hypothesis, we combined anterograde and retrograde tracing, terminal optogenetic stimulation,
IPSC recording, and single-cell RT-PCR (Fig. 2) to show that
vLPOVgat→DMD connections are critical for bidirectionally
regulating Tcore and activity. Interestingly, we found that the
vLPOVgat neurons preferentially innervated DMDVgat neurons,
compared with DMDVglut2 neurons (Fig. 2H).
Previous studies have shown that DMD neurons, especially
glutamatergic neurons, play an important role in promoting
thermogenesis (16–18, 29, 30). However, the response of these
neurons to thermal stimuli was unknown. Here, we recorded
calcium dynamics in the DMD by using fiber photometry and
found, surprisingly, that both glutamatergic and GABAergic
neurons were activated by cooling (25–13 °C; Fig. 3 D and E), but
that these neurons responded with different dynamics. The glutamatergic neurons responded more abruptly and their response
decayed more quickly compared with the GABAergic neurons
(SI Appendix, Fig. S5). Consistent with these kinetics, we found
that increases in Tcore, EE, and activity levels resulting from
CNO-mediated activation of DMD glutamatergic neurons arose
more rapidly and decayed more quickly than those elicited by
CNO-mediated activation of DMD GABAergic neurons (Fig. 4
and SI Appendix, Fig. S8).
The role played by GABAergic neurons in the DMD in
thermoregulation has not been studied previously, although the
DMD contains more GABAergic than glutamatergic neurons
(31). Here, we have shown unequivocally that these GABAergic
neurons are essential for controlling thermogenesis. Their activation strongly promoted increases in Tcore, EE, and physical
activity (Fig. 4 E–H and SI Appendix, Fig. S5), whereas their
suppression reduced Tcore and activity (Fig. 5 C and D). We
therefore have uncovered a type of thermogenic neuron.
Several reports have suggested that neurons expressing the leptin
receptor (LepR) in the DMD are important for thermogenesis
(19–21). Cold-induced cFos expression colocalizes with LepR
(21), and activation of these LepR neurons increases Tcore and
EE (19). Our immunostaining results suggest that DMDLepR
neurons contain both glutamatergic and GABAergic types, with the
majority being glutamatergic (SI Appendix, Fig. S9). Thus,
DMDLepR neurons might be a downstream target of the vLPOVgat
neurons.
It remains unclear how DMD neurons are connected with
premotor neurons to direct thermogenesis. Early observations
suggested that glutamatergic neurons may project directly to
premotor neurons within the rostral medullary region (rMR) to
promote thermogenesis (16–18). It has also been reported that
rMR premotor neurons receive inhibitory inputs from other
medullary regions (32, 33). Thus, DMDVglut2 neurons may directly innervate rMR premotor neurons to promote thermogenesis, and DMDVgat neurons might disinhibit rMR neurons by
suppressing their inhibitory inputs.
Delineating the specific neural cell types involved in thermoregulation is a key step toward understanding these critical
neural circuits. Using the PhosphoTRAP approach (34), which
enables the immunoprecipitation of translational ribosomes via
phosphorylated ribosomal protein S6 (a marker of neural activity), we (SI Appendix, Fig. S10) and Tan et al. (35) independently
discovered that brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), a
classic neurotrophic factor (36), is transcriptionally activated
following heat challenge and is a novel marker for heat-activated
neurons. It is interesting to see that heat affects the expression of
a neurotrophic factor, suggesting that long-term heat challenge
may affect nerve growth and cause remodeling of thermoregulatory networks. The exact role played by BDNF in this context
must be further tested. BDNF-expressing neurons in the ventromedial preoptic nucleus (VMPO) can drive hypothermia
without affecting physical activity (35). Thus, the circuits involving VMPOBDNF neurons and vLPOVgat neurons may act
coordinately to regulate EE, BAT thermogenesis, activity, and
vasodilation to lower Tcore.
Our results establish a neural circuit (Fig. 5E) for regulating
heat loss behaviors, in which environmental heat indirectly activates POA glutamatergic neurons (refs. 1–3, 5, and 6 and SI
Appendix, Fig. S3), which may, in turn, activate a population of
GABAergic neurons in the vLPO (Fig. 1 and SI Appendix, Fig.
S4). The vLPO GABAergic neurons inhibit thermogenic neurons in the DMD to suppress EE and activity, thereby lowering
Tcore (Figs. 2, 4, and 5). The DMD neurons include both glutamatergic and GABAergic subtypes and are cold activated (Fig. 2
and 3). DMD glutamatergic neurons may send excitatory input
to premotor neurons in the rMR to stimulate thermogenesis (16–
18). DMD GABAergic neurons might disinhibit rMR premotor
neurons by suppressing their inhibitory inputs (32, 33).
