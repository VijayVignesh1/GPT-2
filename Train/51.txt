O-GlcNAc glycosylation (or O-GlcNAcylation) is a dynamic, inducible posttranslational modification found on proteins associated
with neurodegenerative diseases such as α-synuclein, amyloid precursor protein, and tau. Deletion of the O-GlcNAc transferase (ogt)
gene responsible for the modification causes early postnatal lethality
in mice, complicating efforts to study O-GlcNAcylation in mature
neurons and to understand its roles in disease. Here, we report that
forebrain-specific loss of OGT in adult mice leads to progressive neurodegeneration, including widespread neuronal cell death, neuroinflammation, increased production of hyperphosphorylated tau and
amyloidogenic Aβ-peptides, and memory deficits. Furthermore, we
show that human cortical brain tissue from Alzheimer’s disease patients has significantly reduced levels of OGT protein expression
compared with cortical tissue from control individuals. Together,
these studies indicate that O-GlcNAcylation regulates pathways critical for the maintenance of neuronal health and suggest that dysfunctional O-GlcNAc signaling may be an important contributor to
neurodegenerative diseases.
O-GlcNAc | glycosylation | neurodegeneration | tau | amyloid beta
Despite the increasing prevalence of neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer’s disease (AD) and Parkinson’s
disease, there still are no effective treatments to prevent, cure, or
stop neurons from degenerating. Neurodegeneration at the cellular level involves the dysfunction of several processes important for proper neuronal function and health, including synaptic
plasticity (1), autophagy (2), mitochondrial dynamics (3), and
cellular metabolism (4). An improved understanding of the
protective factors responsible for maintaining neuronal health is
essential for uncovering the biology of neuropathies and the
development of more effective treatments for neurodegenerative
conditions.
O-GlcNAc glycosylation (or O-GlcNAcylation) is a dynamic
posttranslational modification that regulates important processes
such as transcription (5, 6), proteostasis (7), the stress response (8),
autophagy (9), and metabolism (6, 10). The O-GlcNAc transferase
enzyme OGT catalyzes the covalent attachment of N-acetyl-D-glucosamine to serine or threonine residues of proteins, whereas
β-N-acetylhexosaminidase (also known as “O-GlcNAcase,” OGA)
removes it (6). Although OGT is ubiquitously expressed, it is
particularly abundant in neurons, where it is enriched in the nucleus (6) and at synapses (11). OGT participates in specialized
neuronal processes, including activity-dependent transcription and
long-term depression via regulation of cAMP-responsive element
binding protein (CREB) (5) and the AMPA receptor GluA2
subunit (12), respectively. O-GlcNAcylation also has been implicated in neurodegenerative diseases and is reported on proteins
such as amyloid precursor protein (APP) (13), α-synuclein (14),
neurofilament M (NFM) (15), and tau (16). Several studies have
suggested neuroprotective roles for the modification. For example, increasing global levels of O-GlcNAcylation in neurons decreased the production of pathological forms of NFM and tau
(15, 16) and directly inhibited the aggregation of both tau (17) and
α-synuclein (18). Glycosylation of nicastrin, a component of the
γ-secretase complex, enhanced the nonamyloidogenic processing
of APP (13, 19). Moreover, raising O-GlcNAcylation levels by
pharmacological inhibition of OGA attenuated amyloid-β deposition,
tau phosphorylation, motor deficits, and memory impairments in
certain AD mouse models (17, 19). On the other hand, studies also
have suggested neurodegenerative roles for O-GlcNAcylation. For
instance, increasing O-GlcNAcylation levels exacerbated neurodegenerative phenotypes of tauopathy, amyloid β-peptide, and polyglutamine expansion in Caenorhabditis elegans models, whereas
decreasing O-GlcNAcylation levels rescued those phenotypes
(20). Thus, it is unclear whether O-GlcNAcylation has neuroprotective or neurodegenerative functions and whether aberrant
O-GlcNAc signaling plays a direct role in the induction of neuronal pathology in vivo.
Understanding the functions of O-GlcNAcylation in the mature
brain and in neurodegenerative diseases has been complicated
by the difficulty of knocking out the ogt gene. Because OGT is
ubiquitously expressed and is essential for cell-cycle progression
and proliferation (6), constitutive deletion of OGT in mice
resulted in embryonic lethality, and neuron-specific OGT deletion
using a Syn1-Cre transgene led to severe developmental defects,
increased phosphorylation of tau, and early postnatal lethality
(21). In this study, we produced a forebrain-specific OGT conditional knockout (OGT cKO) mouse to assess the effects of
O-GlcNAc depletion on learning, memory, and neuronal function in adult mice. The mice were phenotypically normal at
birth but at 2 mo of age developed signs of severe, progressive
neurodegeneration, including loss of neurons, gliosis, increased
Significance
O-GlcNAcylation is an abundant posttranslational modification
suggested to have both neuroprotective and neurodegenerative
functions. Although previous studies on O-GlcNAc have illustrated
its potential to modulate preexisting phenotypes in neurodegenerative animal models, the importance of O-GlcNAcylation in both
the induction of neuropathology and the functioning of healthy
adult neurons remained unclear. We generated a forebrain-specific O-GlcNAc transferase conditional knockout mouse and found
that diminution of O-GlcNAc signaling induced progressive neurodegeneration in vivo, including pathogenic processing of tau
and amyloid precursor protein, widespread neuronal death, gliosis, and memory loss. These results indicate that O-GlcNAcylation
regulates pathways critical for neuronal health and survival and
that modulating O-GlcNAc signaling may represent a neuroprotective strategy for neurodegenerative diseases.

Results
Generation of Forebrain-Specific OGT cKO Mice. We generated OGT
cKO mice by crossing floxed ogt (OGTfl) mice (21) with αCamKIICre transgenic mice (22). Because the αCamKII-Cre transgene is
expressed between postnatal day 14–21 in excitatory neurons in the
postnatal forebrain, including the cortex, hippocampus, caudate
nucleus, thalamus, and hypothalamus (22), this approach circumvents complications associated with OGT ablation during prenatal
development. OGT cKO mice were produced at expected frequencies and were indistinguishable from their WT littermates at
birth. However, they began to show a significant reduction in weight
gain at 7 wk of age (11% at 7 wk and 32% at 16 wk) (Fig. 1A). Loss
of OGT protein expression occurred in hippocampal CA1, dentate
gyrus (DG), and cortical neurons and coincided with the time
course of O-GlcNAc signal depletion (Fig. S1). Beginning at 1 mo
of age, O-GlcNAcylation was undetectable with a pan-specific
O-GlcNAc antibody in 5–15% of hippocampal CA1, DG, and cortical neurons (Fig. 1 B and C). By 2–4 mo, depletion of O-GlcNAcylation peaked in 30–50% of CA1, DG, and cortical neurons (Fig.
1C). By 6 mo, only 10–20% of the neurons lacked O-GlcNAc because of progressive neuronal death following OGT ablation. No
change in OGT expression or O-GlcNAcylation levels was found in
the cerebellum, which lacks αCaMKII-Cre transgene expression
(Fig. S2). The observed forebrain-specific deletion of ogt was confirmed further by crossing the αCaMKII-Cre mice with RosaYFPfl
mice (Fig. S2) and coincided well with previous examples of gene
inactivation induced by the αCaMKII-Cre transgene (22).
Loss of O-GlcNAcylation in OGT cKO Mice Leads to Progressive
Neurodegeneration. Loss of OGT was accompanied by a diminution in the overall brain size and a progressive, profound reduction
in hippocampal and cortical neurons (Fig. 2A). Global changes in
brain morphology were detectable by Nissl staining, which revealed
a dramatic shrinkage of the hippocampus and cortex by 4 mo (Fig.
2B) and a significant decrease in cortical thickness at 4 and 6 mo
(Fig. 2C). In the DG, a 23, 70, and 83% decrease in neuronal
density was observed by neuronal nuclear antigen (NeuN) staining
at 2, 4, and 6 mo, respectively (Fig. 1D). Similarly, neuronal loss
was observed in the CA1 region of the hippocampus (20, 60, and
60% decrease in neuronal density at 2, 4, and 6 mo, respectively),
although the cortical neuronal density did not change (Fig. 1D),
likely because of the significant reduction in cortical thickness.
To evaluate the mechanism of neuronal death, we used TUNEL
and Fluoro-Jade C (FJC) staining. The majority of DG neurons
were TUNEL+ in 2-mo-old OGT cKO mice (Fig. 2D), demonstrating the presence of extensive apoptosis in the hippocampus. In
addition, FJC staining revealed that more than 60% of DG neurons
had degenerated at 2 mo (Fig. 2E). FJC staining also was observed
in the cortex, increasing fivefold from 2 mo to 4 mo of age (Fig. S2).
In contrast, no detectable labeling of hippocampal neurons by
TUNEL or FJC was observed in WT mice. Interestingly, although
most FJC+ neurons lacked O-GlcNAcylation, some neighboring
O-GlcNAc+ neurons were also FJC+ (arrowheads in Fig. 2E).
Increased Anxiety and Memory Impairments in OGT cKO Mice. To
assess the functional consequences of conditional OGT knockout,
we evaluated the mice in a series of behavioral tasks. At 5 mo of
age, OGT cKO mice exhibited an excessive grooming phenotype
and deficits in nest-making ability. In addition, OGT cKO mice
displayed impaired exploratory behavior compared with WT mice

in an open field test, including a reduction in the time spent in the
center of the field and the total distance traveled (Fig. 3A).
Rotarod tests revealed no differences between OGT cKO and WT
mice, suggesting that the differences in the open field test were
caused by increased anxiety-like behaviors rather than by motor
function defects (Fig. S3).
We also used a fear-conditioning paradigm to evaluate changes
in the ability of OGT cKO mice to learn new associations. When
tested 24 h after fear conditioning, the cKO mice displayed a small
but significant deficit in amygdala-dependent cued freezing behavior at 2 mo but no change in hippocampus-dependent contextual freezing behavior (Fig. 3B). By 4 mo, however, significant
deficits in both cued and contextual fear-related freezing behavior
were observed (Fig. 3B). These results are consistent with the
temporal pattern of neurodegeneration detected by histology and
demonstrate a progressive impairment of fear-related associative
learning and memory upon OGT depletion.
Up-Regulation of Immune-Response and Cell-Cycle–Related Genes.
To identify global transcriptional changes associated with the
behavioral and histological phenotypes, we performed gene-expression microarray analyses. At 3 wk of age, only 10 differentially
expressed genes were identified in the hippocampus of OGT cKO
mice compared with WT mice, consistent with the minimal extent of
OGT ablation and neuronal loss shown by histology (Fig. 1D and
Table S1). In contrast, we observed a dramatic up-regulation of more
than 900 genes in the hippocampus of 2-mo-old OGT cKO mice
(Table S2). Among the most highly up-regulated genes were glial
immune-response genes such as glial fibrillary acidic protein (Gfap),
complement component 1q (C1q), and complement component 3
(C3). Increased expression of these and other representative genes
was confirmed independently by quantitative RT-PCR (qRT-PCR)
(Table S3). Notably, many of the same genes are up-regulated in
established familial AD mouse models (Table S3) (23, 24). Furthermore, genes that showed little alteration in the AD mouse
model Tg2576/PS-1P264L/P264L, such as those encoding for GAP43,
syntaxin, synaptophysin I, and synaptotagmin-I, were not differentially expressed in OGT cKO mice (Table S4) (23). Overall, the
similarities in the transcriptional profiles between OGT cKO mice
and AD mouse models suggest that they may share common underlying mechanisms of neurodegeneration.
To determine whether entire networks of genes were deregulated in OGT cKO mice, a weighted gene coexpression network
analysis (WGCNA) was performed to organize genes into biologically meaningful groups. WGCNA identified two gene
modules that were significantly correlated with OGT deletion
[cor = 0.71 (P = 3.8 × 10−28 and cor = 0.77 (P = 1.2 × 10−18)]
(Fig. S4). Using Gene Ontology analysis, we found that one
module was enriched with genes involved in the immune response
(P < 3.4 × 10−4
) such as Bcl-2 homologous antagonist killer
(Bak1) and SH2-domain containing phosphatidylinositol-3,4,5-
trisphosphate 5-phosphatase 2 (Inppl1). Bak1, a central proapoptotic member of the Bcl-2 family, is required for mitochondrial
permeabilization and release of cytochrome c into the cytosol in the
early stages of apoptosis (25). Enhanced expression of apoptosisand immune-related genes is consistent with the extensive apoptosis
(Fig. 2D) and gliosis (see Fig. 5A) observed in OGT cKO mice and
with the up-regulation of immune-response genes observed in other
AD mouse models (24). A second module was enriched with genes
involved in cell-cycle arrest (P < 3.8 × 10−5
), including antigen Ki-67
(Mki67), protein regulator of cytokinesis 1 (Prc1), and kinetochore
protein Spc25 (Spc25) (Fig. S4).
To explore further the connection between OGT ablation and
cell-cycle arrest, we probed OGT cKO mice for evidence of altered neuronal cell-cycle progression. Although immunostaining
of hippocampal neurons for proliferating cell nuclear antigen
(PCNA) and BrdU revealed no appreciable differences (Fig. S5),
we observed a significant increase in the levels of cyclin A2 in
OGT cKO mice compared with WT mice (Fig. 4A). Cyclin A2 is
an initiator of DNA replication during S-phase and is a wellestablished marker for cell-cycle progression (26). Moreover, the
protein expression levels of cyclin-dependent kinase 5 (CDK5), a
negative regulator of cell-cycle progression, decreased significantly in OGT cKO mice compared with WT mice, as determined by Western blot analysis (Fig. 4B). Although there was
no change in CDK5 mRNA levels (Table S2), immunohistochemistry (IHC) analysis also indicated a specific reduction in
CDK5 protein levels in O-GlcNAc–null hippocampal neurons
(Fig. 4C), suggesting the potential for posttranscriptional regulation of CDK5 by O-GlcNAc. Taken together, these WGCNA,
IHC, and Western blot analyses provide evidence of enhanced
cell-cycle progression in the hippocampus of OGT cKO mice.
OGT cKO Mice Recapitulate Neurodegenerative Phenotypes. Gliosis,
the activation of microglia and astrocytes, is associated with neuroinflammation and the pathology of neurodegenerative disease.

OGT cKO mice displayed extensive gliosis, consistent with the
observed up-regulation of immune-response genes. The astrocyte marker GFAP and the microglial marker Iba-1 were significantly increased (6.5- and 14.9-fold, respectively) in the
hippocampus of OGT cKO mice compared with WT mice beginning at 2 mo of age (Fig. 5A). By 4 mo, gliosis had spread to
the cortex (Fig. S5) and was strongly correlated with the spatiotemporal loss of O-GlcNAcylation (Fig. 1C).
To determine whether OGT cKO mice displayed other neurodegenerative phenotypes, we investigated the levels of tau phosphorylation and aggregation. Phosphorylation of tau at Thr-205
and Thr-231 has been associated with paired-helical filamentous
(PHF) tau oligomers, which aggregate to form neurofibrillary
tangles (NFTs) (27). We observed increased tau phosphorylation at
these sites (1.8- and 2.9-fold, respectively) in the mossy fibers and
cell bodies of DG neurons in OGT cKO mice compared with WT
mice (arrowheads in Fig. 5B). This result was confirmed further by
Western blot analysis, which demonstrated a significant increase
in phosphorylated tau (1.4-fold each for pSer-202/Thr-205 and
pThr-231) (Fig. 5C) in the hippocampus of OGT cKO mice. Interestingly, although an inverse relationship between tau phosphorylation and O-GlcNAcylation has been observed (16, 17), the
overall levels of tau O-GlcNAcylation at Ser-400 were not significantly decreased in the hippocampus of 2-mo-old OGT cKO mice
compared with WT mice (Fig. S5). Because phosphorylation of tau
at these sites has been linked to its aggregation, Thioflavin S was
used to evaluate the presence of protein aggregates in the hippocampus. At 6 mo of age, OGT cKO mice displayed Thioflavin S+
protein deposits that were costained with a pThr-205 tau antibody
(6.9-fold increase) (Fig. 5D and Fig. S5).
Soluble oligomeric Aβ-peptides, which are produced by the
proteolytic processing of APP, have been shown to inhibit hippocampal LTP, disrupt cognitive function, and induce apoptosis
(28). We observed a 6.8-fold increase in the level of the 42-mer
Aβ-peptide and a 2.7-fold increase in the level of the 40-mer Aβpeptide by ELISA in 6-mo-old OGT cKO mice compared with
WT mice (Fig. 5E). Moreover, the ratio of 42/40-mer peptide
increased by 2.5-fold, indicating enhanced accumulation of the
more amyloidogenic 42-mer peptide (Fig. 5E) (28).
OGT Levels Are Decreased in Human AD Brains. In light of the
marked neurodegenerative phenotypes of OGT cKO mice, we
examined whether human AD brains had reduced levels of OGT
expression at the cellular level. Previously, both increases and
decreases in O-GlcNAcylated proteins had been reported in the
cerebral cortex of AD brains compared with control individuals (29,
30). Notably, we found that cortical neurons from severe AD patients (Braak stage VI) displayed a 1.6-fold decrease in OGT protein levels compared with age- and sex-matched controls (Fig. 6), as
revealed by IHC staining with an anti-OGT antibody. OGT protein
levels in midstage AD patients (Braak stages IV and V) were also
depleted, supporting the trend observed in severe AD patients, although the decrease was not statistically significant. These results
demonstrate a correlation between lower OGT expression levels
and the pathology of human neurodegeneration.
Discussion
In this study, we generated a forebrain-specific ogt cKO mouse to
study the roles of O-GlcNAcylation in adult neurons. Because
the mice survived to adulthood, the effects of ogt deletion on
learning, memory, and adult neuronal function could be evaluated directly. Loss of OGT led to progressive neuronal death and
other phenotypes associated with neurodegenerative diseases,
including gliosis, activation of immune-response and cell-cycle
genes, aberrant phosphorylation of tau, and amyloidogenic Aβ-42
peptides. OGT cKO mice also displayed behavioral deficits such
as abnormal nesting behavior, memory impairments, and increased anxiety, which are characteristics observed in neurodegenerative mouse models of AD (31), obsessive-compulsive disorder
(32), and schizophrenia (33). Notably, we found that human AD
patients showed a significant decrease in OGT protein expression
levels in the frontal cerebral cortex compared with control individuals, and this decrease correlated with progressive cognitive decline.
Together, our studies reveal important neuroprotective roles for
O-GlcNAcylation and suggest that alterations in O-GlcNAc signaling may contribute to neuronal pathology.
Both tau phosphorylation and APP processing were significantly
altered in OGT cKO mice. Upon ogt deletion, we observed enhanced tau aggregation and hyperphosphorylation at sites associated with neurofibrillary tangles. These findings further support
previous studies suggesting a reciprocal relationship between
O-GlcNAc and phosphorylation on tau. For example, increasing
global O-GlcNAc levels reduced tau phosphorylation at Ser-199,
Thr-212, Thr-217, Ser-262, Ser-396, and Ser-422 in mouse brain
slices (16). Moreover, inhibition of OGA elevated O-GlcNAc
levels and decreased tau hyperphosphorylation in an AD mouse
model (17). Although we observed no significant change in the
levels of tau O-GlcNAcylated at Ser-400, it is possible that
O-GlcNAcylation of tau is differentially regulated at specific sites

or that a small amount of residual OGT may be sufficient to maintain
O-GlcNAc levels at this site.
Previous studies have suggested that higher O-GlcNAcylation
levels can enhance nonamyloidogenic processing of APP by raising
α-secretase activity (13) and lowering γ-secretase activity (19). In
accordance with these observations, we found that loss of OGT enhanced the pathological processing of APP in vivo, increasing the
ratio of the amyloidogenic 42-mer Aβ-peptide to the 40-mer. Notably, accumulation of hyperphosphorylated tau and Aβ-peptides is not
observed in many neurodegenerative mouse models, and the two
phenotypes are rarely observed together. For example, 5XFAD mice
that express five different familial AD mutations in APP and presenilin1 showed no accumulation of hyperphosphorylated tau (34),
and mutant P301L tau transgenic mice displayed no increases in
amyloid beta load (35) despite the presence of extensive neuronal
death. Thus, the defects in tau phosphorylation and APP processing
observed in OGT cKO mice are not likely to be indirect effects
caused by a global requirement for OGT in proper neuronal function
and survival. Together, the findings suggest that the O-GlcNAc
modification plays a central role in regulating both APP and tau and
that dysfunctional O-GlcNAc signaling may contribute to improper
APP processing and tau pathology.
We performed gene microarray analyses to obtain insights into
the global, systems-level changes induced by loss of OGT. Our
studies revealed that several cell-cycle genes, including Mki67,
Prc1, and Spc25, were up-regulated in OGT cKO mice. Consistent with an important role for OGT in cell-cycle regulation,
O-GlcNAcylation previously has been shown to modulate cellcycle progression by prolonging cyclin A and B expression and
catalyzing proteolytic maturation of the critical cell-cycle regulator, host cell factor-1 (HCF-1) (36, 37). Interestingly, several
genes involved in controlling oxidative stress were also significantly up-regulated in OGT cKO mice, including heme oxygenase 1 (Hmox1), cyclooxygenase 1 (Ptgs1), and activity-dependent
neuroprotective protein homeobox 2 (ADNP2). O-GlcNAcylation
previously has been shown to be required for stress granule assembly in response to oxidative stress and to decrease oxidative
stress in cardiomyocytes by reducing reactive oxygen species (8, 38).
Thus, one important mechanism by which OGT may exert its neuroprotective effects is through the regulation of critical cell-cycle
regulators and modulators of oxidative stress. The two-hit hypothesis
of AD postulates that both oxidative stress and mitotic dysregulation
are necessary and sufficient to cause the neurodegeneration associated with AD (39). Further supporting the gene-expression analyses,
we found that cyclin A2, a marker of cell-cycle progression, was
increased in OGT cKO mice, providing strong evidence for enhanced cell-cycle progression in the hippocampi of these mice.
Moreover, CDK5 protein expression levels were significantly
decreased upon loss of OGT. CDK5 represses neuronal cell-cycle
advancement (40) and is an important upstream regulator of oxidative stress through phosphorylation of peroxiredoxin I/II and
p53 (39). Interestingly, a recent paper suggests that blocking
O-GlcNAcylation of CDK5 can lead to neuronal apoptosis by
enhancing its association with the p53 pathway (41). Several other
studies have implicated aberrant cell-cycle advancement in ADassociated neurodegeneration through deregulation of CDK5 levels
and activity (40, 42). Together, these results suggest that a major
mode by which OGT ablation leads to neurodegeneration is
through cell-cycle dysfunction. Future studies will focus on understanding the detailed mechanisms by which OGT affects CDK5
function, the cell cycle, and oxidative stress in neurons.
Lagerlöf et al. reported that the tamoxifen-induced deletion of
ogt from αCaMKII+ neurons in adult mice leads to obesity caused
by overeating (43). This phenotype was the result of reduced
satiety caused by OGT ablation in the paraventricular nucleus
(PVN) of the hypothalamus. Interestingly, no change in neuronal
number in the hippocampus or PVN was noted upon quantification of DAPI+ cells, although the age of the mice analyzed was not
reported. There could be several explanations for the phenotypic
differences between Lagerlöf’s model and ours. First, there likely
are differences in the timing of the OGT knockout in the
αCaMKII-Cre versus the αCaMKII-CreERT2 tamoxifen-inducible
systems. In our study, loss of OGT and O-GlcNAcylation began at
4 wk of age, and the neuronal loss and degenerative phenotypes
were not significant until 8 wk of age. In the Lagerlöf study, tamoxifen injections were initiated at 6 wk of age, and phenotypic
responses were monitored up to 4 wk later. Second, it is possible
that the neurodegenerative phenotypes were not yet apparent
during the window of their study, because tamoxifen-induced Cre
recombination can take several days. Furthermore, variability in
the location and timing of αCaMKII promoter-driven Cre recombination has been described previously and attributed to differences in the location of αCaMKII-Cre transgene insertion
within the genome (44). Alternatively, excitatory forebrain neurons may be more vulnerable to OGT deletion at specific stages of
maturation. Last, any effects on satiety in our model were likely
obscured by the strong neurodegenerative phenotype. The phenotypic differences between the two OGT cKO models suggest
that OGT plays specific roles in neuronal health and homeostasis
during various stages, and they underscore the importance of the
precise spatiotemporal coordination of O-GlcNAcylation.
The O-GlcNAc modification appears to play multiple, complex
roles in neurodegeneration, and previous studies paradoxically have
suggested that decreasing O-GlcNAcylation has both neuroprotective and neurodegenerative effects (17, 20). We show that loss
of O-GlcNAcylation in healthy neurons leads to progressive neurodegeneration in vivo, providing strong evidence that O-GlcNAc has
neuroprotective functions in adult mammalian neurons. The neurodegenerative, transcriptional, and behavioral phenotypes observed
in OGT cKO mice are shared by many AD mouse models, suggesting common mechanisms of neurodegeneration. It is noteworthy
that loss of OGT alone is sufficient to induce neurodegenerative pathologies and that this neurodegeneration occurs relatively rapidly.
Induction of such phenotypes in other mouse models generally requires mutation or overexpression of multiple familial AD-related
proteins such as tau, APP, and presenilin (31), and the pathological
phenotypes take 9–12 mo to progress (23, 31). The rapid course of
neurodegeneration in OGT cKO mice underscores the critical importance of OGT in the maintenance of adult neuronal health and
suggests that dysfunctional O-GlcNAc signaling may be an important
contributor to neuronal pathology. Collectively, our studies provide a
direct link between the ablation of O-GlcNAcylation and the induction of neurodegenerative phenotypes, suggesting that strategies to
control O-GlcNAcylation and its neuroprotective effects may represent an approach for the treatment of neurodegenerative conditions.

Methods
Human Tissue. Brain samples of frontal cortex from control (n = 6), Braak stage
VI (n = 8), and Braak stage IV-V (n = 4) patients were obtained from the
Alzheimer’s Disease Research Center at the University of California, Los Angeles.
Samples were from patients with a similar age, sex, and postmortem interval.
Mice. αCaMKII-Cre mice were provided by Mary Kennedy, California Institute of
Technology, Pasadena, CA (22), and OGTfl mice (B6.129-Ogttm1Gwh/J) were
purchased from Jackson Laboratories. Both lines were backcrossed six times into
the C57/Bl6 background. Details of breeding are provided in SI Methods. All
animal procedures were performed in accordance with the NIH Guide for the
Care and Use of Laboratory Animals and approved by the Institutional Animal
Care and Use Committee of the California Institute of Technology.
IHC. Mice were transcardially perfused with 4% (wt/vol) paraformaldehyde
(PFA) and were fixed overnight in 4% (wt/vol) PFA at 4 °C, followed by
cryoprotection with 15–30% (wt/vol) sucrose. Sagittal sections (20 μm)
were obtained using a Leica CM1850 cryostat and were stored in an ethylene glycol solution at −20 °C. Slices were stained with primary antibody in
2% (vol/vol) goat serum, 0.1% Triton-X 100 in PBS overnight at 4 °C. Slices
were mounted with Vectashield (Vector Labs, H1200), coded, and imaged with
a Zeiss 700 confocal microscope, with the investigator blind to the genotype.
Images were collected from slices spaced 100 μm apart through the region of
interest. A minimum of 12 slices were quantified for each animal, and a
minimum of four animals were evaluated for each genotype. Quantification of
fluorescence intensity was performed as previously described (45) and was
analyzed using a two-tailed, unpaired Student’s t test.
Additional materials and methods, including detailed IHC procedures, behavioral experiments, ELISA, microarray, and qRT-PCR analyses, are provided in
SI Methods. A list of primers used in this study can be found in Table S5.
