In mammalian neurons, the axon initial segment (AIS) electrically
connects the somatodendritic compartment with the axon and
converts the incoming synaptic voltage changes into a temporally
precise action potential (AP) output code. Although axons often
emanate directly from the soma, they may also originate more
distally from a dendrite, the implications of which are not wellunderstood. Here, we show that one-third of the thick-tufted layer
5 pyramidal neurons have an axon originating from a dendrite and
are characterized by a reduced dendritic complexity and thinner
main apical dendrite. Unexpectedly, the rising phase of somatic
APs is electrically indistinguishable between neurons with a somatic
or a dendritic axon origin. Cable analysis of the neurons indicated
that the axonal axial current is inversely proportional to the AIS
distance, denoting the path length between the soma and the start
of the AIS, and to produce invariant somatic APs, it must scale with
the local somatodendritic capacitance. In agreement, AIS distance
inversely correlates with the apical dendrite diameter, and model
simulations confirmed that the covariation suffices to normalize
the somatic AP waveform. Therefore, in pyramidal neurons, the AIS
location is finely tuned with the somatodendritic capacitive load,
serving as a homeostatic regulation of the somatic AP in the face of
diverse neuronal morphologies.

computational model
The axon initial segment (AIS) specifies in vertebrate neurons
a single domain for the final integration of synaptic input and
the initiation of action potentials (APs) (1, 2). To rapidly produce large inward and outward currents mediating the AP, the
AIS contains a complex arrangement of cytoskeletal and transmembrane proteins clustering high densities of voltage-gated
sodium (Nav) and potassium (Kv) channels in the axolemma
(2–4). Although the composition of ion channels is critical for
initiation and regulation of firing patterns, there are emerging
insights that the AIS is not operating in isolation but is also
subject to activity-dependent changes in size and location
constrained by the local dendritic branch geometry and the
passive cable properties (5–7). Experimental studies linking
changes in AIS length and neuronal output showed that an increased length facilitates AP generation (6, 8). In these cases, the
net increased excitability is a logical consequence of the larger
Nav conductance. However, predicting the impact of AIS location
on neuronal output is more complex. Experimental studies
showed that an activity-dependent distal shift of the AIS is associated with decreased AP output (5). In contrast, model simulations showed that shifting the AIS distally promotes excitability
(9). One of the critical factors influencing AIS excitability is the
large somatodendritic membrane area acting as current sink for
sodium current generated in the AIS (10–12). In this view, a distal
anatomical location of the AIS increases electrical compartmentalization and facilitates axonal AP generation. Indeed, the local
depolarization in the AIS is proportional to the axial resistance
between the soma and the AP initiation site, which increases with
distance from the soma (11). However, increasing the distance
between soma and AIS will be unfavorable for synapse to spike
coupling, because it increases voltage attenuation and thereby,
reduces the possibility for synaptic potentials to cross the AP
threshold in the AIS (13). Furthermore, pyramidal neurons require axonal APs to rapidly depolarize the soma and activate
somatic voltage-gated Nav channels to produce the dendritic
back-propagating AP (14, 15).
In view of the importance of AIS location in neuronal excitability, it is striking that the reported intercellular variability
within neuron cell types is large. In 50 to 70% of dopaminergic
and GABAergic neurons of the substantia nigra, the axon arises
from dendrites, even up to ∼260-μm distance from the soma
(16–18). In fact, an axon origin from a dendrite is even a defining feature of some hippocampal interneurons (19, 20).
Furthermore, about 30 to 60% of the pyramidal neurons in the
hippocampus have an axon emerging from a basal (or sometimes, an apical) dendrite up to ∼40-μm distance from the soma
(20, 21), and also, in the neocortex, axons have been observed to
emerge from basal dendrites (19, 22, 23). Here, we investigated
whether AIS location plays a functional role in neocortical pyramidal neuron excitability. We found that AIS distance from
the soma but not length strongly and inversely correlates with
the dendritic morphology and follows the theoretical relationship predicted by cable theory when resistive coupling between
the soma and axon adjusts a longitudinal current that normalizes somatic AP generation. The large intercellular variation in
AIS location thus reflects structural homeostatic scaling to normalize the somatic AP in the face of diverse morphologies of
dendritic trees.
Significance
Neurons generate highly reliable and temporally precise action
potentials with a spatial onset in the axon initial segment. The
axon initial segment location relative to the soma is, however,
highly variable across neurons within the same cell class. Here,
we experimentally and theoretically investigated the structure–
function relationship of axon distances in neocortical pyramidal
neurons. We discovered a scaling principle between the size of
the dendritic tree and the axon distance supported by the cable
properties and electrophysiological recordings. The work reveals
that axons are not randomly positioned but covary with dendrites normalizing the somatic action potential in the face of
diverse cellular morphologies.

Results
Thick-Tufted Layer 5 Neurons Have Diverse Axonal Origins. To characterize the diversity in axon locations in layer 5 pyramidal neurons,
we colabeled tissue sections containing the primary somatosensory
hind limb region from adult Wistar rats with Gp-anti–NeuN, a
somatodendritic marker, Rb–anti-Ankyrin G, an AIS marker, and
M-anti–SMI-32 (Sternberger monoclonal-incorporated antibody
32), a neurofilament marker, for type 1 (thick-tufted) layer 5 neurons (24) (Fig. 1A). SMI-32+ primary axons could be observed
emanating from either the soma or a basal dendritic branch (Fig.
1B). Population analysis (n = 7 animals; two to three sections per
animal) showed that neurons with an axon origin from a dendrite,
hereby referred to as “axodendritic” neurons, constitute one-third
of the population of SMI-32+ neurons (Fig. 1C). The large fraction
of pyramidal neurons with an axon starting from a basal dendrite
may indicate that they represent a distinct subtype. Based on
electrophysiological and anatomical features, two major types of
layer 5 pyramidal neurons have been identified: intracortically
(corticocortical) projecting slender tufted layer 5 neurons and
subcortically [corticosubcortical (CS)] projecting thick-tufted layer 5
neurons (24–26). Although SMI-32 typically labels thick-tufted layer
5 neurons, they may be further divided into subpopulations (24, 25).
To test whether axodendritic and axosomatic neurons project to
different targets, we injected fluorescent retrograde beads in the
spinal cord (C2/3) (Fig. S1). Fluorescent retrobeads were localized
exclusively in the somata of superficial and deep layer 5 neurons in
the somatosensory and motor cortices. From a total of 313 analyzed
neurons, 178 were back-labeled with fluorescent retrobeads. Within
the population of layer 5 neurons with identified axon origin (somatic
or dendritic), 58% of the axosomatic neurons projected to C2/3 (n =
160 of 277) compared with 46% of the axodendritic neurons (n = 17
of 37; Fisher’s exact test, P = 0.2167) (Fig. S1), indicating equal
subcerebral targeting of both subtypes. Next, we made whole-cell
recordings from visually identified pyramidal layer 5 neurons and
filled them with biocytin for posthoc immunofluorescence using βIVspectrin to identify the axon location (n = 38 cells; 27 animals).
Similarly, a large fraction of neurons was axodendritic (50%; n = 19
of 38). The dendritic organization of both subtypes showed that
apical dendrites branched extensively in layer 1, consistent with a CS
cell type (Fig. 1D, Fig. S2, and Table S1). Interestingly, quantitative
analysis showed that the sum of dendritic branches was smaller in the
basal region of the axodendritic neurons (Fig. 1E and Table S1). This
difference was further supported by a Sholl analysis revealing that the
density of basal dendrites was significantly lower in axodendritic
neurons (two-way ANOVA, P < 0.05, n = 26) (Fig. 1F). Additional
comparison of branches as a function of distance from the soma
showed that axodendritic neurons have fewer (basal and apical)
dendritic sections within a proximal region of 100–200 μm from the
cell body and a lower complexity of both basal and apical dendritic
sections (Fig. 1 F and G). Taken together, these results indicate that
the subcellular axon origin is not associated with a specific subtype
but is associated with quantitative differences in the dendritic tree.

The Dendritic Morphology Scales Specifically with AIS Distance. Salient
characteristics of axodendritic layer 5 neurons were their relatively
narrow diameter of the proximal apical dendritic trunk (Fig. 2 A
and B and Table S2) and smaller somatic cross-sectional area (Fig.
2 A and B and Table S2), consistent with their reduced dendritic
organization (Fig. 1 E and F). To obtain a single measure for AIS
location, we determined the AIS distance (AISΔ) as the linear path
length from the base of the soma to the start of the dense expression of either βIV-spectrin or Ankyrin G (Fig. 2A). In contrast
to previous observations in mouse hippocampal pyramidal neurons
(21), we never detected Ankyrin G or βIV-spectrin immunofluorescence signals in the dendritic branches connecting the axon,
suggesting that AISΔ accurately reflects the anatomical distance
from the soma. In axodendritic neurons, AISΔ was significantly
more distal compared with axosomatic neurons (Fig. 2 A and B and
Table S2). The size of the AIS compartment was, however, constant; neither AIS length nor the 2D area were different between
subtypes (Table S2). Interestingly, specifically, the AISΔ inversely
and strongly correlated with the apical dendrite diameter (Fig. 2C
and Table S3). A correlation between the axonal and dendritic
organization was further corroborated when plotting AISΔ against
the total number of dendritic nodes (Fig. 2D and Table S3) and the
total dendritic length as well as the total dendritic area (Fig. S3). In
contrast, neither AIS length nor the area correlated with apical
dendritic diameter (Table S3). These findings suggest that, in the
population of thick-tufted layer 5 neurons, the AISΔ is fine-tuned
with the anatomical organization of dendrites.
Somatodendritic Capacitive Load Predicts Axonal Coupling Resistance.
To examine whether AISΔ, ranging from 1.5 to 20 μm, impacts
neuronal excitability, we examined the somatically recorded AP
properties. The first rate of rise (dVm dt –1
) component of the somatic
AP reflects the axonal axial current charging the somatodendritic
capacitor (14). If the local somatodendritic capacitance is constant,
dVm dt –1 is expected to vary as a function of AISΔ because of the
axial resistance (Ra). In striking contrast to the predictions, the first
peak in the dVm dt –1 showed no difference between the subtypes
(Fig. 3 A–C, Fig. S4, and Table S4), and did not correlate with
AISΔ (Fig. 3C). Similarly, the second, somatic component was also
not different (Table S4). Also, the onset rapidness, defined as the
slope of a linear fit to the AP phase plot (dVm dt –1 vs. Vm; with
units of milliseconds–1
), was not different (∼78 ms–1
) (Table S4).
Theoretical work predicts that increasing AISΔ is associated
with a more hyperpolarized AP voltage threshold (11). Although
AP voltage threshold was significantly more hyperpolarized in
axodendritic neurons (∼3 mV, P = 0.0005) (Table S4), it did not
correlate with AISΔ (r = –0.332, P = 0.055) (Table S3). The AP
voltage threshold rather correlated with the apical dendritic diameter (r = 0.488, P = 0.003) (Table S3), and the larger apical
dendritic diameter (capacitive load) required larger current amplitudes to reach threshold compared with axodendritic neurons
(P = 0.0095) (Table S4). Taken together, AISΔ alone does not
explain differences in spike generation.
If the maximal Nav conductance (gNa) within the AIS is constant,
the axial current should theoretically be larger with a more proximal
AIS location. Because the somatodendritic capacitance (Cm) acts as
a current sink, the axial current Iaxon should flow toward the soma
and leave the neuron as capacitive current: Iaxon = Cm × dVm dt –1
.
Based on these concepts, we hypothesized that the larger capacitance of axosomatic neurons is matched with the larger axial
current expected for more proximal AIS locations. This idea is
supported by the observation that apical dendrites in the axosomatic
neurons are, on average, ∼2 μm larger in diameter (Fig. 2 A and B)
and strongly correlated with the AISΔ (Fig. 2C and Table S3). It
may be predicted that AISΔ is inversely proportional to the capacitance of a characteristic length of apical dendrite, which scales
as d−3=2
, where d is the apical dendritic diameter. Indeed, correlation of the transformed geometrical data showed that AISΔ is wellpredicted by apical d−3=2 (Fig. 3D). To examine more closely the
relationship with resistive coupling ðRaÞ, we determined for each
cell the specific coupling Ra based on the 3D reconstructions assuming a specific intracellular cytoplasmic resistance ðRi) of 150 Ω
cm (Materials and Methods). Interestingly, there was a strong linear
relationship between Ra and AISΔ (Fig. 3E), suggesting that branch
diameters are not greatly different between the subtypes. Next,
using the coupling Ra estimates, we tested whether apical d−3=2 is a
predictor for Ra and found a significant linear relationship (Fig. 3F).
These data suggest that resistive coupling increases with smaller
dendritic capacitance to reduce Iaxon during spike initiation and that
the scaling of coupling Ra with dendrites is independent of a somatic or dendritic origin of the axon.
Biophysical Analysis of Dendritic and Axonal Tuning of the Somatic
AP. To understand how AISΔ influences the capacitive depolarization of the somatodendritic membrane by the axonal AP,
we examined a simple biophysical model consisting of a cylindrical axon (diameter of 1.5 μm) connected to a larger cylindrical
somatodendritic compartment (diameter of 6 μm and length of

500 μm) (Fig. 4A). Kv channels, somatodendritic Nav conductance,
and the inactivation component of Nav channels were excluded
(11). When Nav channels open, the membrane potential in the AIS
rises toward the sodium reversal potential (ENa) (Fig. 4B). Because
there were no Nav channels between soma and AIS in the model,
this region should be mostly resistive (resistance Ra). Therefore,
the axonal current should be Iaxon =ðENa − VsÞ=Ra, where Vs is the
somatic voltage. We assumed that Vs remains far from ENa and
close to spike threshold during the initial rise of the somatic AP
owing to the large somatodendritic capacitance (more precisely, Vs
rises from spike threshold to somatic threshold, both well below
ENa). This simplified account indicated that Iaxon ∝1=Ra, and because resistance is linearly proportional to the path length (Fig.
3E), it follows that Iaxon ∝1=ðAISΔÞ. A more precise analysis yields
Iaxon ∝ 1=ðAISΔ +δÞ, where δ is a positive shift calculated from the
parameters (Fig. S5 and SI Materials and Methods). Iaxon must
charge a large cylindrical somatodendritic compartment with a
dendritic diameter (d). The voltage response of a cylinder to a
current scales with diameter as d−3=2 (27). Therefore, for the
voltage response at the soma to be independent of the diameter,
AISΔ must scale as d−3=2 (Materials and Methods and Fig. S5). As
predicted, peak Iaxon and dVm dt –1 do not depend on leak currents
(Fig. S5) or AIS length in the range tested but are inversely related
with AISΔ (Fig. 4C). In general, our theoretical analysis predicts
that initial dVm dt –1 should scale with dendritic diameter as d−3=2
,
and we found numerically and theoretically that those scaling factors were well in line with the experimentally observed relationship
(Fig. 4D). Finally, is the covariation between dendrites and axons
sufficient to tune the somatic AP? To test this idea, we varied
the dendritic diameter between 2 and 8 μm in the model and tuned
the AISΔ so as to obtain a constant somatic dVm dt –1 of 350 V s–1
.
The results from the numerical simulation (Fig. 4E) agreed well
with this prediction and showed that the AISΔ and the dendritic
size interact as observed experimentally (compare with Fig. 3D).

conductance-based multicompartmental model based on an axosomatic layer 5 pyramidal neuron (Materials and Methods and Fig.
5A). Based on the βIV-spectrin immunofluorescence signal, the
AISΔ (2.1 μm) and AIS length (39.5 μm) were precisely implemented in the model (28) (Fig. S6). To test the role of Ra in the
optimized model, we fixed the diameter of the section representing
AISΔ to 2 μm and varied the segment length between 2 and 40 μm
(Fig. 5 B and C). The critical role of AISΔ was evident by the steep
hyperpolarization of the voltage threshold (Fig. S6) and the decrease of the initial dVm dt –1 of the model APs (Fig. 5C) in similar
magnitude as predicted with the simplified biophysical model (Fig.
4C). With an AISΔ of 30 μm, the initial dVm dt –1 reduced substantially, causing a temporal delay in the onset of the somatic AP
and producing, subsequently, AP reflection in the axon. With an
AISΔ of 40 μm, the somatic AP failed (Fig. 5 B and C). Increasing
AISΔ thus facilitates axonal output but negatively impacts the antidromic AP. Finally, to test whether the reduction of Iaxon with
distal AIS positions can be accounted for by reducing the somatodendritic capacitive load, we positioned the AIS at ∼18 μm from the
soma. The AIS shift reduced the initial rising phase of the somatic
AP by ∼179 V s–1 (Fig. 5D), in line with the expected increase in
resistive coupling (Fig. 4C). Furthermore, in agreement with the
numerical and theoretical predictions, when the somatic and apical
dendritic diameters were reduced by 30% (reflecting the average
dendritic diameter of axodendritic neurons) (Fig. 2B), the initial peak
in the dVm dt –1 increased selectively and reached approximately
similar amplitude compared with the control AP (Fig. 5D). Together,
these simulations with realistic morphologies show that covariation of
dendritic geometry and AIS distance suffices to tune the somatic AP.
Discussion
In this study, we identified that a large fraction of adult thicktufted rat layer 5 pyramidal neurons has an axon emanating from
a basal dendrite (Fig. 1). These observations are in line with
earlier reports using Golgi staining or EM from layer 2/3 or 5
pyramidal cells in a range of different cortical areas and species
(19, 22, 23) or in hippocampal pyramidal neurons (20, 21) and
support the notion that variation in axon location is a common
principle of the cellular architecture of pyramidal cells. Cable
theory predicts that the axial resistance between the AIS and the
soma has a strong impact on spike initiation (11). Although the
resistive coupling values across the population spanned more
than one order of magnitude (from ∼0.1 to 2.5 MΩ) (Fig. 3), we
surprisingly could not identify a functional impact of AISΔ on
somatically recorded AP properties (Table S3). To achieve uniform APs at the soma, our theoretical analyses and compartmental
simulations predict that AISΔ should be inversely related with the
local somatodendritic capacitance. The anatomical properties of
layer 5 pyramidal neurons were well in line with these theoretical
predictions and revealed a strong correlation, with the correct order of magnitude, with the apical dendrite diameter and number of
dendritic nodes (Fig. 2 and Table S3). These experimental results
support the theory of resistive coupling (11), predicting that the
main determinants of the first component of the somatic AP are
local geometry and intracellular resistivity.
Scaling of AIS location with somatodendritic morphology may be
a general feature of neurons. For example, in midbrain dopaminergic neurons, axons often emanate from a dendrite that is larger
in diameter (16–18). In these cells, the dendritic APs are electrically
isolated during synaptic potentials and often characterized by
temporal imprecision, failure, reverberation, and/or reflection (18).
Because dopaminergic cells release neurotransmitter from somatodendritic sites, it is thought that dendritic origin of the AIS facilitates somatodendritic autoinhibition (18). In other cell types, the
AIS location is linked to unique electrical computations. For example, in auditory neurons in chicks, the AIS distance, ranging
between 0- and 50-μm distance, is adapted to enable frequency
tuning (6, 13). Consistent with predictions from axial resistive
coupling, the distal AIS position in these cells is characterized by
smaller somatic AP amplitudes but with the distinct advantage of
axonal AP output being phase-locked to higher input frequencies in
the kilohertz range. Uncoupling the axon from charging the soma in
some cell types, thus, benefits local axonal computations.
In pyramidal neurons, however, the AIS not only integrates incoming synaptic inputs and transforms them into output patterns but
at the same time, plays a critical role in the antidromic direction to
depolarize the somatodendritic membrane capacitance with sufficient magnitude and speed to activate the somatic Nav channels
initiating the back-propagating spike (15, 29, 30). These observations
of invariable somatic APs are in agreement with recordings in hippocampal CA1 pyramidal neurons with AIS distances ranging between ∼1.0 and 20 μm showing little, if any, difference in the somatic
AP (21). In that study, it was shown that axon coupling to basal
dendrites facilitates synapse-evoked dendritic spike generation in the
axon-carrying dendrite (21). Although we did not examine the
presence of local basal dendritic spikes, our integrated electrophysiological and morphological approach suggests that the anatomical

arrangement may rather serve geometrical homeostasis, normalizing
the amplitude and rise time of the somatic AP. Back-propagating
APs are implicated in a wide range of dendritic computations (31),
acting as a retrograde signal for nonlinear integrative functions in the
dendritic branches of cortical pyramidal neurons (32–34). Tuning the
position of the axon and local dendritic area may ensure amplitude
and temporal fidelity of the back-propagating spike during its transition from the axon to the soma and dendritic branches.
The cellular and molecular mechanisms tuning the somatodendritic geometry together with the axon location remain to be determined. During the first weeks of development, when the
dendritic tree rapidly expands, the AIS also shifts from its distal site
to a more proximal location near the soma (35) and dynamically
changes in length (36). One mechanism identified for activitydependent changes in AIS location includes the Ca2+ influx from
L-type Ca2+ channels subsequently activating the cytosolic signaling
pathways, including the Ca2+
-calmodulin–sensitive phosphatase
calcineurin (37). Such a molecular mechanism may also be suitable
to link local somatodendritic Ca2+ elevations with cytoskeletal organization along the axon. This hypothesis remains to be established and would require simultaneous morphological analysis of
dendrites and axons. The finding of a structural homeostatic scaling
between axons and dendrites in pyramidal neurons may also have
implications for the interpretation of activity-dependent relocation
of the AIS along the longitudinal axis of the axon (5). Rather than
reducing intrinsic excitability, our modeling predicts that shifting the
AIS alone distally would weakly promote axonal firing (Fig. 5),
consistent with theoretical and modeling results (9, 11). Furthermore, our results indicate that, in cortical pyramidal cells, the anatomical location of the AIS is to a large degree covarying with the
local somatodendritic membrane area, ensuring the generation of
uniform somatic APs in the face of highly variable dendritic loads.
