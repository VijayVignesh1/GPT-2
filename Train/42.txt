Achromatopsia is an autosomal recessive disorder characterized by
cone photoreceptor dysfunction. We recently identified activating
transcription factor 6 (ATF6) as a genetic cause of achromatopsia.
ATF6 is a key regulator of the unfolded protein response. In response to endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress, ATF6 migrates from
the ER to Golgi to undergo regulated intramembrane proteolysis
to release a cytosolic domain containing a basic leucine zipper
(bZIP) transcriptional activator. The cleaved ATF6 fragment migrates to the nucleus to transcriptionally up-regulate protein-folding enzymes and chaperones. ATF6 mutations in patients with
achromatopsia include missense, nonsense, splice site, and single-nucleotide deletion or duplication changes found across the
entire gene. Here, we comprehensively tested the function of achromatopsia-associated ATF6 mutations and found that they group
into three distinct molecular pathomechanisms: class 1 ATF6 mutants show impaired ER-to-Golgi trafficking and diminished regulated intramembrane proteolysis and transcriptional activity; class
2 ATF6 mutants bear the entire ATF6 cytosolic domain with fully
intact transcriptional activity and constitutive induction of downstream target genes, even in the absence of ER stress; and class 3
ATF6 mutants have complete loss of transcriptional activity because of absent or defective bZIP domains. Primary fibroblasts
from patients with class 1 or class 3 ATF6 mutations show increased cell death in response to ER stress. Our findings reveal that
human ATF6 mutations interrupt distinct sequential steps of the
ATF6 activation mechanism. We suggest that increased susceptibility to ER stress-induced damage during retinal development underlies the pathology of achromatopsia in patients with ATF6 mutations.

Achromatopsia is a heritable blinding disease caused by cone
photoreceptor dysfunction that spares the rod system. Using
next-generation whole-exome sequencing, we recently discovered autosomal recessive mutations in the activating transcription factor 6 (ATF6) gene in patients with achromatopsia (1).
ATF6 mutations span the entire coding region and include missense, nonsense, splice site, and single-nucleotide deletion and
duplication changes (1–3). We previously showed that a missense
mutation that introduced an arginine-to-cysteine substitution at
amino acid residue 324 of the ATF6 protein compromised ATF6
activity in patient fibroblasts obtained from an achromatopsia
family (1). However, the functional consequences of the other ATF6
mutations found in patients with achromatopsia remain unknown.
In humans, ATF6 is a 670-amino acid glycosylated transmembrane protein found in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) (4).
In response to protein misfolding in the ER or other forms of ER
stress, ATF6 migrates from the ER to the Golgi apparatus, where
the site 1 protease (S1P) and site 2 protease (S2P) cleave ATF6 in
the transmembrane domain to liberate the cytosolic domain of
ATF6 (4–6). The cytosolic domain contains a transcription factor of
the basic leucine zipper (bZIP) family (4). Upon release from the
Golgi membrane, the free ATF6 cytosolic transcriptional activator
fragment migrates to the nucleus to bind DNA and transcriptionally
up-regulate target genes that include ER protein folding chaperones and enzymes (4, 7, 8). Via this signal transduction mechanism,
ATF6 activation helps restore ER protein folding homeostasis and
alleviates ER stress (9).
Here, we investigated how ATF6 mutations found in patients
with achromatopsia affect ATF6’s molecular mechanism of signaling and activation, using patient fibroblasts and recombinant
mutant ATF6 proteins. We identified a class of ATF6 mutations
in the luminal domain that reduce ATF6 signaling by impairing
ER-to-Golgi trafficking of full-length ATF6 during ER stress.
We identified a second class of ATF6 mutations near the transmembrane domain that have the potential to produce intact ATF6
cytosolic fragments with fully functional transcriptional activator properties. Last, we identified a third class of ATF6
mutations in the cytosolic domain that cause the loss of ATF6
function by deletion or mutation of the bZIP and/or transcriptional activator domain. Patient fibroblasts with loss-offunction ATF6 mutations exhibited significantly increased cell
death in response to ER stress.
Significance
The unfolded protein response regulator activating transcription factor 6 (ATF6) was recently identified as a novel genetic
cause of the cone photoreceptor disease achromatopsia. ATF6
upregulates genes that help cells cope with endoplasmic reticulum stress. We identified the pathomechanisms of all ATF6
achromatopsia mutations. Class 1 ATF6 mutants show impaired
endoplasmic reticulum (ER)-to-Golgi trafficking and diminished
production of the transcriptional activator fragment. Class 2
mutants encode the intact ATF6 transcriptional activator domain with full activity. Class 3 mutants have defective basic
leucine zipper (bZIP) domains with abrogated function. Patient
fibroblasts show increased apoptosis after ER stress. Our
findings reveal that human ATF6 mutations interrupt distinct
steps of ATF6 activation. ER stress-associated damage may
underlie the pathology of achromatopsia arising from ATF6.

Results
Class 1 ATF6[Y567N] Mutation Impairs ER-to-Golgi Trafficking During
ER Stress. Four achromatopsia-associated ATF6 mutations introduce missense or frame shift changes in exons encoding the
ER luminal domain of ATF6 (Fig. S1) (1, 3). We previously identified a family with a tyrosine-to-asparagine substitution at amino
acid position 567 in the luminal domain of ATF6 (1). We obtained
fibroblasts from two unaffected heterozygous (ATF6Y567N/+
) parents, probands 1 and 2, and a homozygous (ATF6Y567N/Y567N) affected child, patient 3 (Fig. 1A). We found comparable levels of
ATF6 mRNA and full-length ATF6 protein in heterozygous and
homozygous fibroblasts under standard cell culturing conditions
(Fig. 1 B and C). During ER stress conditions experimentally
induced by tunicamycin application, ATF6 mRNA levels and the
full-length ATF6 protein levels were up-regulated in both heterozygous and homozygous fibroblasts compared with the untreated samples (Fig. 1 B and C). However, significantly reduced
levels of the cleaved ATF6 cytosolic fragment were seen in homozygous ATF6Y567N/Y567N fibroblasts compared with heterozygous controls in response to experimental ER stress induced by
DTT (Fig. 1D). These findings showed that ATF6 mRNA and
full-length protein were normally generated in the ATF6Y567N
mutant, but during ER stress, lower levels of the cleaved functional transcriptional activator domain of ATF6 were present in
ATF6Y567N/Y567N fibroblasts despite normal to increased levels of
full-length ATF6 protein compared with heterozygous controls.
Consistent with reduction of the ATF6 transcriptionally active
fragment, we found reduced levels of BIP/GRP78 mRNA and
protein, an ER chaperone transcriptionally up-regulated by
ATF6 (4, 7, 10), in ATF6Y567N/Y567N fibroblasts compared with
heterozygous controls in response to experimental ER stress
(Fig. 1 E and F). These findings revealed that the luminal ATF6
[Y567N] mutation resulted in the impairment of ATF6 signaling
in ATF6Y567N/Y567N fibroblasts during ER stress.
ATF6 signaling is a key component of the unfolded protein
response (UPR) and operates in parallel with UPR signal
transduction pathways controlled by the inositol-requiring enzyme 1 (IRE1) and PKR-like endoplasmic reticulum kinase
(PERK) proteins to ensure normal ER function in mammalian
cells (11, 12). We next examined whether the other branches of
the UPR were also dysregulated in ATF6Y567N/Y567N fibroblasts.
We assayed two specific molecular events of the IRE1 UPR
signaling pathway, XBP1 mRNA splicing, an early proximal
event specifically initiated by IRE1 activation (13, 14), and
ERdj4 transcription, a downstream target gene induced by IRE1
signaling (Fig. 1 E and G) (7, 8, 15, 16). For the UPR signaling
pathway regulated by PERK, we examined levels of phosphorylated eIF2α protein, an early proximal event in the PERK signal
transduction pathway (17, 18), and CHOP mRNA transcript, a
downstream target gene potently up-regulated by PERK signaling (Fig. 1 E and H) (19). For these IRE1 and PERK pathway
markers, we observed a small (<10%) but statistically significant decrease in ERdj4 and CHOP transcript levels between
ATF6Y567N/Y567N fibroblasts and heterozygous controls (Fig. 1 E–H).
These studies revealed that ATF6Y567N/Y567N fibroblasts with
compromised ATF6 signaling also showed mild impairment of the
transcriptional output of other UPR pathways during ER stress.
Next, we investigated the mechanism underlying the reduction
in levels of the cleaved ATF6 fragment observed during ER
stress in ATF6Y567N/Y567N fibroblasts. To ensure that the ATF6
protein level differences were not a result of fibroblast cell line
differences, we expressed FLAG-tagged full-length wild-type
ATF6 or mutant ATF6[Y567N] in HEK293 cells. Similar to our
findings in the primary patient fibroblasts, we observed significantly reduced levels of cleaved ATF6 in response to ER stress
induced by DTT in cells expressing ATF6[Y567N] compared
with wild-type ATF6 (Fig. 2A). In response to ER stress, fulllength ATF6 traffics from ER to Golgi, where the Golgi-resident
S1P and S2P proteases cleave the full-length protein to liberate
the cytosolic transcriptional activator ATF6 fragment. We examined whether defects in ER-to-Golgi trafficking were responsible for the reduced production of cleaved ATF6 seen with
the ATF6[Y567N] mutant. First, we compared the sensitivity
with endoglycosidase H (Endo H) of wild-type ATF6 and the
ATF6[Y567N] mutant. Prior studies had demonstrated that
ATF6 was glycosylated with high mannose N-glycan in the ER
and that this glycosylated ATF6 isoform was sensitive to Endo H
(4, 5). When ATF6 traveled to Golgi during ER stress, the high
mannose N-glycan of ATF6 was trimmed by glycosidases in the
Golgi to produce an Endo H-resistant full-length ATF6 that
could be transiently visualized by SDS/PAGE in cells before
undergoing S1P protease cleavage (5).

NEUROSCIENCE
We found that both wild-type ATF6 and the mutant
ATF6[Y567N] underwent glycosylation in the ER and showed
identical Endo H sensitivity profiles (Fig. 2B). However, when we
added S1P inhibitor and analyzed protein lysates collected from
cells treated with DTT, we saw an Endo H-resistant ATF6 isoform only with wild-type ATF6 (Fig. 2B). This finding provided
biochemical evidence that the mutant ATF6[Y567N] trafficked
poorly from ER to Golgi compared with the wild-type protein
during ER stress. Consistent with these biochemical results,
when we examined the subcellular localization of ATF6 by fluorescence confocal microscopy, we found colocalization of wildtype ATF6 and the Golgi marker Golgi membrane protein
1 (GOLPH2), in response to ER stress induced by DTT (Fig.
2C, upper two rows). However, the mutant ATF6[Y567N] and
GOLPH2 remained in separate subcellular compartments with
no colocalization of fluorescent signals under the same experimental conditions (Fig. 2C, bottom two rows). We confirmed that
both wild-type and mutant ATF6[Y567N] were localized in the ER
under resting (nonstressed) conditions, as evident by colocalization
with the ER resident protein, PDI (Fig. S2). Another luminal
domain mutant, ATF6[D564G], also showed impaired cleavage
and trafficking in analogous assays (Fig. 2 D and E). In sum, our
studies revealed that the mechanism underlying attenuation of
transcriptional activity in class 1 ATF6 luminal domain mutants
arose from an unexpected defect in the process of ER-to-Golgi
trafficking in response to ER stress, leading to reduced production
of the cleaved transcriptional activator domain of ATF6.
Constitutive Transcriptional Activity in Class 2 ATF6 Mutants. The
amino terminal domain of ATF6 is a 370–380-amino acid bZIP
transcription factor, and expression of recombinant ATF6 protein bearing only the first 373 amino acids from ATF6’s cytosolic
domain reconstituted the transcriptional activity of ATF6 in
mammalian cells (4, 20). Intriguingly, three of the ATF6 mutations identified in patients with achromatopsia were predicted to
create ATF6 fragments of similar length to the ATF6(373)
transcriptionally active fragment (Fig. S1 and refs. 1 and 3). To
determine whether this group of ATF6 mutations showed functional activity, we expressed a recombinant FLAG-tagged ATF6
bearing a frame-shift mutation that caused a valine-to-serine
substitution at amino acid 371 of ATF6, followed by a stop codon
three amino acids distally, ATF6[V371Sfs*3]. We found that the
ATF6[V371Sfs*3] protein showed nearly identical size mobility
to ATF6(373) in transfected HEK293 cells (Fig. 3A, compare
lane 5 and lane 2). We also found that ATF6[V371Sfs*3] transcriptionally induced ATF6 downstream target genes, BIP/
GRP78, HERPUD1, and SEL1L, as potently as ATF6(373) (21)
(Fig. 3B). The expression of CHOP was also up-regulated by
both ATF6(373) and ATF6[V371Sfs*3] (Fig. 3B). In analogous
studies, we also found that the ATF6[R376*] mutant showed
nearly identical size mobility to ATF6(373), and induction of
ATF6 downstream target gene, BIP/GRP78 (Fig. S3). These
findings demonstrated that the recombinant mutant ATF6
[V371Sfs*3] and ATF6[R376*] proteins are fully functional
transcriptional activators in vitro. In vivo, the amount of functional truncated ATF6[V371Sfs*3] and ATF6[R376*] proteins
may be less than wild-type ATF6 protein levels because the
nonsense and premature stop codons found in these mutants
may subject their mRNA transcripts to nonsense-mediated
mRNA decay (NMD) (1).
Class 3 ATF6 Mutants Are Transcriptionally Inactive. Five ATF6
mutations found in patients with achromatopsia introduce nonsense or premature stop codons in exons encoding the cytosolic
domain of ATF6 and are predicted to produce ATF6 cytosolic
protein fragments with nonfunctional bZIP or lacking the entire
bZIP and transcriptional activator domains (Fig. S1 B and C and
refs. 1 and 2). To test whether this group of ATF6 mutations
compromised ATF6 function, we expressed recombinant FLAGtagged ATF6 bearing several of these mutations, including a
proline-to-leucine mutation at position 118, followed by a premature stop codon 31 amino acids distally, ATF6[P118Lfs*31],
which lacks the bZIP domain and part of the transcription activator domain, and a nonsense mutation of an asparagine residue at position 267, ATF6[N267*], which lacks only the bZIP
domain. We detected protein expression of these truncated ATF6
mutants after transfection into HEK293 cells (Fig. 3A), but found
no transcriptional induction of ATF6 target proteins with either
mutant (Fig. 3 A and B). Coupled with our prior studies of the
ATF6[R324C] mutant (1), these results identify a class of diseaseassociated ATF6 mutations that cause loss of function through
disruption of transcriptional activity by truncating the bZIP and/or
transcriptional activator domains or by directly mutating critical
residues in the bZIP domain in the ATF6 cytosolic domain.
To determine how the loss of ATF6 activity affected other
signaling arms of the UPR in patient cells with this class of mutations, we examined fibroblasts previously collected from a family

expressing the ATF6[R324C] mutation (1). These included an
unaffected heterozygous parent (ATF6R324C/+
), proband 1, and
three affected homozygous achromatic children (ATF6R324C/R324C),
patients 2, 3, and 4 (Fig. 4A). We found comparable levels of
ATF6 mRNA and full-length ATF6 protein in heterozygous and
homozygous fibroblasts (Fig. 4 B and C). During experimentally
induced ER stress conditions, we found increased levels of ATF6
mRNA and protein in heterozygous and homozygous fibroblasts
(Fig. 4 B and C). However, we found reduced levels of BiP/GRP78
protein in ATF6R324C/R324C fibroblasts compared with heterozygous controls in response to experimental ER stress consistent
with our prior studies that showed that the ATF6[R324C] mutation compromised ATF6 signaling activity (Fig. 4C). This signaling
defect arose from impairment of the bZIP transcriptional activator domain itself, and not at earlier steps in the trafficking or
production of the cytosolic ATF6 fragment, because full-length
ATF6[R324C] protein underwent ER-to-Golgi trafficking (Fig. 5
B and C) and produced the cleaved ATF6 transcriptional activator
fragment with similar kinetics to the wild-type protein in response
to ER stress (Fig. 5A).
We next examined whether the IRE1 and PERK signaling
branches of the UPR were dysregulated in ATF6R324C/R324C fibroblasts. For IRE1 pathway markers, we saw no difference in
XBP1 mRNA levels or XBP1 mRNA splicing between
ATF6R324C/R324C fibroblasts and heterozygous control (Fig. 4D
and Fig. S4). However, we saw significantly reduced transcriptional induction of ERdj4 in ATF6R324C/R324C fibroblasts compared with heterozygous control (Fig. 4 D and E). For the
PERK pathway markers, we saw no difference in eIF2α phosphorylation between ATF6R324C/R324C fibroblasts and heterozygous control (Fig. 4C). However, we saw significantly reduced
transcriptional induction of CHOP in ATF6R324C/R324C fibroblasts compared with heterozygous control (Fig. 4 C and F).
These studies revealed that ATF6R324C/R324C fibroblasts show
compromised ATF6 transcriptional activity as well as significant impairment of the transcriptional output from the IRE1
and PERK signaling branches of the UPR during ER stress.
Class 1 and Class 3 ATF6 Mutant Fibroblasts Are More Susceptible to

protein folding chaperones and enzymes (7). If ER stress is not
alleviated, cells ultimately undergo cell death (22, 23). We
compared kinetics of cell death in patient fibroblasts expressing
the class 1 and class 3 ATF6 mutants to see how the loss of ATF6
function affected survival during extended ER stress. In response
to thapsigargin exposure, we observed significantly increased
levels of the apoptosis marker, cleaved poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP), in ATF6Y567N/Y567N fibroblasts compared with
heterozygous controls (Fig. 6A, cf. patient 3’s fibroblasts with
those of patients 1 and 2). Similarly, we observed increased levels
of PARP cleavage in ATF6R324C/R324C fibroblasts compared with
heterozygous parental control (Fig. 6B, cf. patients 2, 3, and 4
with patient 1’s cells). These studies revealed that a physiologic
consequence of the loss of ATF6 function caused by class 1 and
class 3 ATF6 mutations was heightened cell death in response to
ER stress.
Discussion
Our studies provide a framework for functional and pathomechanistic classification of ATF6 mutations identified in
achromatopsia (Fig. S1). Class 1 mutations affect the luminal
domain of ATF6 and lead to loss of function. The pathomechanism underlying loss of function in class 1 ATF6 mutations
is inefficient trafficking from ER to Golgi during ER stress,
leading to poor production of the ATF6 transcriptional activator
fragment (Fig. S1A). Class 2 mutations cluster near the transmembrane domain of ATF6. These mutations produce the entire
cytosolic ATF6 fragment unbound to membrane and show fully
intact ATF6 transcriptional activity (Fig. S1A). The class 2 ATF6
transcripts all bear premature stop codons and are likely targets
of nonsense-mediated mRNA decay machinery (1). Nonsensemediated decay reduces mRNA transcript levels by ∼50–85%,
depending on tissue type and environmental factors (24). Therefore, whether class 2 mutations produce significant amounts of
cytosolic ATF6 transcriptional activator fragment and show constitutive signaling in vivo requires further analysis in patients with
these mutations. Class 3 mutations affect the cytosolic domain of
ATF6 and lead to loss of function. The pathomechanism underlying loss of function in this class of mutations is deletion or
mutation of the bZIP and/or transcriptional activator domain.
Do the mechanistic differences we identified between ATF6
mutations lead to phenotypic differences? In particular, we
found that a class 3 mutant had loss of ATF6 signaling plus
significant impairment of the transcriptional output of IRE1 and
PERK signaling (Fig. 4), whereas the class 1 mutant only showed
minor impairment of the transcriptional output of IRE1 and
PERK signaling (Fig. 1). One possibility is that up-regulation of
ER stress genes, such as ERdj4 and CHOP, requires the production of functional ATF6 cytosolic bZIP transcriptional activator domain. In this view, class 1 mutant ATF6 can still produce
a functional cytosolic domain under ER stress, albeit with reduced efficiency. In contrast, class 3 mutant ATF6 produces a
nonfunctional cytosolic domain. This could explain why the upregulation of ERdj4 and CHOP under ER stress is more severely
impaired in class 3 mutant ATF6s. Our identification of distinct
pathomechanisms of ATF6 disease mutations enables prospective longitudinal study of retinal structure and phenotype to
identify possible differences in achromatopsia disease phenotype
and severity between carriers with different classes of ATF6
mutations. Evaluation with adaptive optics and other retinal
imaging modalities may reveal cone phenotype differences corresponding to different classes of ATF6 mutations (25, 26).
What are the therapeutic implications of differences between
ATF6 mutations’ mechanisms of pathology? Class 1 ATF6 mutants inefficiently traffic from ER to Golgi but have normal bZIP
transcriptional activator domains. For this class of mutations, our
findings indicate that therapeutic strategies should focus on
improving protein trafficking out of the ER so the full-length
ATF6 protein can be cleaved by the S1P and S2P Golgi-resident
proteases. Once cleaved and separated from the defective luminal domain, the cytosolic ATF6 domain can engage in its
normal transcriptional activator role. In contrast, the class 3
ATF6 mutants require a different therapeutic approach than
class 1 trafficking mutants because class 3 mutants completely

Gene therapy to introduce functional ATF6 bZIP transcriptional
activator or gene editing to repair the primary ATF6 nucleotide
alterations may be potential therapeutic strategies for patients
with these types of ATF6 mutations.
Our current study highlights the surprisingly diverse molecular
defects in the mechanism of ATF6 activation caused by achromatopsia-associated mutations. Patient fibroblasts with several
of these mutations showed increased sensitivity to ER stressinduced cell death and damage. Diverse environmental insults
have been found to trigger ER stress, including hypoxia, infection, inflammation, protein misfolding, and light damage (27–
33). Exposure to these insults during retinal development may
contribute to the cone dysfunction and vision loss that arises in
children with mutations that compromise ATF6 function.
Materials and Methods
Cell Culture and Transfection. The maintenance and drug treatments of human primary fibroblast cells or HEK293 cells were described in detail in SI
Materials and Methods. The generation of ATF6 mutant plasmids and the
expression of these ATF6 mutants were described in detail in SI Materials
and Methods.
Molecular Biology. Cells were lysed, and total RNA was collected using the
RNeasy mini kit according to manufacturer’s instructions (Qiagen). mRNA
was reverse-transcribed, using the iScript cDNA Synthesis Kit (Bio-Rad). The
methods for analyzing the level of XBP1 mRNA splicing and the qPCR
analysis of gene expression are described in detail in SI Materials
and Methods.
Immunoblotting Analysis. Human fibroblasts or HEK293 cells expressing wildtype or mutant ATF6 were lysed in SDS lysis buffer [2% (g/vol) SDS, 62.5 mM
Tris·HCl at pH 6.8, containing protease inhibitors (Sigma-Aldrich) and phosphatase inhibitor (Thermo Scientific)]. Protein concentrations of the total
cell lysates were determined by bicinchoninic acid (BCA) protein assay
(Pierce). Equal amounts of protein were loaded onto 10% or 4–15% MiniPROTEAN TGX precast gels (Bio-Rad) and analyzed by Western blot, as described in SI Materials and Methods.
Endo H (New England Biolabs) digestion was performed on precleared
total cell lysate for 1 h at 37 °C in the buffer supplied by the manufacturer. To
preclear the cellular debris from the total lysate, cell lysate were spun at
21,900 × g at 4 °C for 1 h.
Immunofluorescence and Confocal Microscopy. Cells were grown on poly-Dlysine coated glass coverslips and transfected with wild-type ATF6 or ATF6
[Y567N]. For immunofluorescence analysis, cells were fixed for 20 min at
room temperature in 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS at pH 7.4, washed briefly
with PBS, and permeabilized with 0.1% Triton X-100 in PBS. Cells were then
washed two times with 1% BSA in PBS and blocked with 5% (vol/vol) goat
serum in 1% BSA/PBS for 20 min. The coverslips were then incubated at
room temperature for 1 h with primary antibodies followed by secondary
antibody incubation as described in SI Materials and Methods. The coverslips
were mounted in ProLong Gold antifade reagent with DAPI (Invitrogen), and
images were collected with an Olympus FluoView-1000 confocal microscope.
