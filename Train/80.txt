At glutamatergic synapses, both long-term potentiation (LTP) and
long-term depression (LTD) can be induced at the same synaptic
activation frequency. Instructive signals determine whether LTP or
LTD is induced, by modulating local calcium transients. Synapses
maintain the ability to potentiate or depress over a wide frequency range, but it remains unknown how calcium-controlled
plasticity operates when frequency variations alone cause differences in calcium amplitudes. We addressed this problem at cerebellar parallel fiber-Purkinje cell synapses, which can undergo LTD or
LTP in response to 1-Hz and 100-Hz stimulation. We observed that
high-frequency activation elicits larger spine calcium transients than
low-frequency stimulation under all stimulus conditions, but,
regardless of activation frequency, climbing fiber (CF) coactivation provides an instructive signal that further enhances calcium
transients and promotes LTD. At both frequencies, buffering
calcium prevents LTD induction and LTP results instead, identifying the enhanced calcium signal amplitude as the critical parameter contributed by the instructive CF signal. These observations
show that it is not absolute calcium amplitudes that determine
whether LTD or LTP is evoked but, instead, the LTD threshold slides,
thus preserving the requirement for relatively larger calcium
transients for LTD than for LTP induction at any given stimulus
frequency. Cerebellar LTD depends on the activation of calcium/
calmodulin-dependent kinase II (CaMKII). Using genetically modified
(TT305/6VA and T305D) mice, we identified α-CaMKII inhibition
upon autophosphorylation at Thr305/306 as a molecular event underlying the threshold shift. This mechanism enables frequencyindependent plasticity control by the instructive CF signal based
on relative, not absolute, calcium thresholds.

Synaptic activation frequency is an important factor in the
induction of long-term potentiation (LTP) and long-term
depression (LTD). For example, it has been shown at Schaffer
collateral-CA1 pyramidal cell synapses that application of 900
pulses at 1–3 Hz causes LTD, whereas the same number of
pulses applied at 50 Hz causes LTP (1). However, LTP and LTD
can also be induced at the same stimulus frequency. This phenomenon has been demonstrated at hippocampal, neocortical,
and cerebellar synapses, where potentiation and depression
mechanisms operate over a wide range of activation frequencies
(2–7). In the neocortex and hippocampus, the level of postsynaptic depolarization determines whether LTP or LTD results
from stimulation at a given frequency (2, 5). These voltage-dependent thresholds for LTP and LTD induction reflect thresholds in calcium signal amplitudes (3, 4, 8–11) that, when
maintained for sufficiently long time periods (12), control synaptic plasticity in concert with distinct calcium sensors that are
restricted to local microenvironments (13, 14).
At cerebellar parallel fiber (PF)-Purkinje cell synapses, both
LTP and LTD can be induced using 1-Hz and 100-Hz PF stimulation protocols, and at both frequencies, climbing fiber (CF)
coactivation promotes LTD, whereas LTP results from PF
stimulation alone (6, 7, 15, 16). CF coactivity leads to supralinear
spine calcium signaling (17), which helps to reach the calcium
threshold for LTD, which is higher than the threshold for LTP at
these synapses (6). It seems that for central synapses, there is
a computational advantage to be able to undergo potentiation
or depression regardless of activation frequency but under the
control of instructive signals, such as CF coactivity in cerebellar
plasticity (18–20). Here, we address a fundamental problem that
arises from LTP and LTD induction under the control of instructive signals over a wide frequency range: How is it possible to
maintain the essential role of calcium thresholds, and the role of
an instructive signal that helps to reach the higher threshold, when
the calcium levels resulting from high-frequency stimulation are
likely in a higher range than the calcium levels resulting from lowfrequency stimulation? The relevance of this problem is illustrated
by the observation that at PF synapses, LTP-inducing 100-Hz PF
bursts evoke larger calcium transients than paired single-pulse CF
activation, which promotes LTD (21). We thus investigated spine
calcium signaling at PF synapses under low- and high-frequency
LTD- and LTP-inducing conditions, as well as mechanisms that
may shift the calcium sensitivity of the LTD pathway.
Results
To monitor spine calcium transients, we used confocal imaging
in slices obtained from P21-75 mice. For the comparison of
calcium levels that are reached under low- and high-frequency
LTD- and LTP-inducing conditions, we applied defined patterns
of PF and CF activation, respectively, that were derived from the
plasticity protocols described below. LTD results from PF + CF
activation at 1 Hz for 5 min, whereas LTP is evoked when the
same PF activation pattern is applied in isolation (6, 16). LTD
Significance
Instructive signals play an important role in synaptic plasticity and learning. For example, at cerebellar parallel fiber (PF)-
Purkinje cell synapses, climbing fiber (CF) coactivation provides
an instructive signal that promotes long-term depression (LTD)
by amplifying spine calcium transients above a threshold level
that, at these synapses, is higher than for LTP induction. Here,
we show that the CF instructive signal maintains its control
over PF plasticity regardless of the PF synaptic activation frequency, which, on its own, alters spine calcium signaling. We
demonstrate that high-frequency stimulation reduces the calcium
sensitivity of LTD, resulting from inhibitory calcium/calmodulindependent kinase II autophosphorylation at Thr305/306. We
propose that this regulatory mechanism causes a horizontal
shift of the long-term potentiation/LTD cross-over point, making plasticity independent from absolute calcium amplitudes.

can also be induced with a train of eight PF stimuli (100 Hz)
followed 120 ms after stimulus onset by single-pulse CF stimulation. This activation pattern is applied at 1 Hz for 5 min. With
this protocol, too, omission of CF activation causes LTP instead
(7). All stimulus protocols cause postsynaptically expressed
forms of LTD/LTP (6, 7). In the following, we will use the terms
“low-frequency protocol” and “high-frequency protocol” to refer
to the highest lead frequency within the PF stimulus patterns.
Thus, 100-Hz PF burst stimulation is referred to as the highfrequency protocol, whereas single-pulse PF stimulation at 1 Hz
is referred to as the low-frequency protocol. For the comparison of calcium levels that are reached under the four activation
conditions, we chose to break down the protocols into the
stimulus patterns that are repeated at 1 Hz for 5 min. For the
high-frequency protocol, this stimulus pattern is a 100-Hz PF
burst (eight pulses), and for the low-frequency protocol, it is a
single PF pulse, which are paired/not paired with CF activation.
Calcium transients evoked in spines on secondary or higher order branches of Purkinje cell dendrites were calculated as ΔG/R =
(G(t) − G0)/R, where G is the calcium-sensitive fluorescence of
Oregon Green 1,2-Bis(2-aminophenoxy)ethane-N,N,N′,N′-tetraacetic acid (BAPTA)-2 (OGB-2; 200 μM), G0 is the baseline
signal, and R is the calcium-insensitive fluorescence of Alexa 633
(30 μM) (22). Calcium transients were monitored under all four
stimulation conditions (applied two to three times in randomized
order, with 30-s intervals between stimuli) from the same spine
that was defined as the region of interest (ROI). The ROI was
selected based on the strength of calcium responses to synaptic
activation (maximally responding spine). To obtain a calcium
transient measure, ΔG/R values were averaged over a period of
200 ms after stimulus onset (17). Single-pulse PF stimulation
resulted in small calcium signals (0.02 ± 0.02 ΔG/R; n = 11; Fig. 1
A–D). Paired PF + CF activation resulted in significantly larger
calcium transients (0.06 ± 0.01 ΔG/R; P = 0.001). Application of
the 100-Hz PF burst evoked calcium signals that were about
threefold as large as the calcium signals obtained with paired PF +
CF single-pulse stimulation (0.18 ± 0.02 ΔG/R; P = 0.00005).
When this 100-Hz PF burst was followed after 120 ms by a single
CF pulse, the resulting calcium transient was further enhanced
(0.24 ± 0.04 ΔG/R; P = 0.041). OGB-2 is a high-affinity calcium
indicator (Kd = 485 nM), allowing for accurate measurement of
calcium in the low-amplitude range. To obtain a better dynamic
range at high calcium amplitudes, we repeated these measurements
using the low-affinity (Kd = 1.8 μM) indicator Fluo-5F (300 μM).
Single-pulse PF stimulation resulted in ΔG/R values in the noise
range (−0.01 ± 0.01 ΔG/R; n = 11; Fig. 1 E–H). However, with CF
coactivation, the signal was significantly enhanced (0.04 ± 0.01
ΔG/R; P = 0.035). A 100-Hz PF burst stimulation resulted in
calcium transients that were about 12-fold larger than the calcium
transients obtained with single-pulse PF + CF activation (0.46 ±
0.15 ΔG/R; P = 0.013). When this 100-Hz burst was followed after
120 ms by a single CF pulse, the calcium signal amplitude was
further enhanced (0.59 ± 0.19 ΔG/R; P = 0.039). With both OGB-2
and Fluo-5F, calcium transients monitored in adjacent shaft areas
showed the same amplitude relationships as calcium transients
measured in the spines (Fig. S1). The results obtained with both
indicators show that 100-Hz PF bursts evoke larger calcium
transients than single pulses, and that CF coactivation further
enhances calcium signals at both frequencies. To compare spine
calcium transients evoked by 100-Hz PF bursts with and without
CF coactivation under conditions that are as remote as possible
from dye saturation, we went a step further and used the ultralow
calcium affinity (Kd = 22.0 μM) indicator OGB-5N (300 μM).
These recordings confirmed our previous observations: paired
100-Hz PF burst + CF activation caused spine calcium transients
(0.32 ± 0.09 ΔG/R) that were significantly larger than spine calcium transients observed with 100-Hz PF burst stimulation alone
(0.21 ± 0.05 ΔG/R; n = 9; P = 0.04338; Fig. S2).
To examine whether larger calcium transients are required for
LTD than for LTP induction in the low-frequency range as well
as the high-frequency range, we applied both LTD protocols
when the calcium chelator BAPTA was added to the pipette
saline. Under control conditions, paired PF + CF activation at
1 Hz for 5 min caused PF-LTD (65.7 ± 6.3%; t = 31–35 min; n = 6;
P = 0.0029; Fig. 2). In line with previous observations (6) application of the 1-Hz LTD protocol instead resulted in LTP (149.1 ±
14.5%; n = 6; P = 0.0198; Fig. 2) when BAPTA (20 mM) was
present in the pipette saline. Excitatory postsynaptic current
(EPSC) amplitude changes observed in these groups differed
significantly (P = 0.0051). Application of the 100-Hz PF burstLTD protocol resulted under control conditions in PF-LTD
(77.9 ± 3.8%; n = 6; P = 0.0008; Fig. 2). For these high-frequency
stimulus experiments, we selected a lower BAPTA concentration (5 mM) than the concentrations that are typically used
to block 1-Hz LTD (10–40 mM) (6, 23, 24). The exact BAPTA
concentration was arbitrarily chosen, but the underlying idea

of selecting a lower concentration was that moderate manipulation of the higher calcium signals observed with the highfrequency LTD protocol (Fig. 1) might be sufficient to evoke a
switch from LTD toward LTP, allowing for a qualitative assessment of the relative calcium dependencies of LTP and
LTD. We indeed observed that LTP was induced instead of
LTD when the 100-Hz burst protocol was applied in the presence of BAPTA (134.3 ± 12.2%; n = 7; P = 0.031; Fig. 2). EPSC
changes observed under these two conditions differed significantly (P = 0.0043).
Calcium transients evoked by 100-Hz PF burst + CF activation
in the presence of BAPTA (5 mM) were significantly lower
than in the absence of BAPTA (+BAPTA: 0.16 ± 0.06 ΔG/R,
n = 8; −BAPTA: 0.59 ± 0.19 ΔG/R, n = 11; P = 0.0349; Fig. S3),
while they did not differ statistically from calcium transients
evoked by LTP-inducing PF burst stimulation (−BAPTA: 0.46 ±
0.15 ΔG/R; n = 11; P = 0.1471). Moreover, these transients were
significantly higher than calcium signals evoked by the LTDinducing single-pulse PF + CF activation (−BAPTA: 0.04 ±
0.01 ΔG/R; n = 11; P = 0.0093; Fig. S3). Similarly, in the
presence of 20 mM BAPTA, single-pulse PF + CF activation caused significantly lower calcium transients than without
BAPTA (+BAPTA: 0.01 ± 0.002 ΔG/R, n = 8; −BAPTA: 0.04 ±
0.01 ΔG/R, n = 11; P = 0.0349; Fig. S3). These calcium transients
were significantly higher than the calcium transients reached with
LTP-inducing single-pulse PF stimulation (−BAPTA; −0.01 ± 0.01
ΔG/R; n = 11; P = 0.0147), but it should be noted that as a result
of the high Kd of Fluo-5F, these latter stimulus conditions do not
reliably evoke transients above noise levels (traces in Fig. S3). To
obtain an approximation of calcium amplitudes reached in spines
during these stimulus conditions, we calculated [Ca2+
]i values
based on the Fluo-5F G/R measures. The calcium signals reached
peak values of about 0.4 μM for single-pulse PF + CF stimulation,
2.8 μM for 100-Hz PF burst stimulation, and 7.1 μM for 100-Hz
PF burst + CF activation (consistent measurements of calcium
levels; see ref. 17). In the presence of BAPTA (5 mM), peak calcium levels evoked by 100-Hz PF burst + CF activation were reduced to about 2.2 μM. No attempt was made to calculate [Ca2+]i
for single-pulse PF stimulation or single-pulse PF + CF stimulation in the presence of BAPTA because these signals were too
close to noise levels in the Fluo-5F recordings.
Together, these observations suggest that regardless of synaptic
activation frequency, additional calcium influx contributed by the
instructive CF signal is required to induce LTD. Hence, while the
absolute calcium levels reached in the high-frequency range are
significantly higher than in the low-frequency range, the relative
calcium thresholds are preserved at both stimulus frequencies.
The transition from absolute to relative calcium thresholds requires that high-frequency stimulation lower the calcium sensitivity of the LTD induction process, in effect shifting the LTD
threshold toward a higher value.
To identify the mechanism behind this threshold shift, we
postulated two requirements that a candidate signaling pathway
needs to fulfill: (i) It requires a calcium sensor to detect the
higher calcium levels resulting from high-frequency activation,
and (ii) it needs to tip the balance from a kinase-dominated
LTD pathway toward a phosphatase-activated LTP pathway at
PF synapses (25, reviewed in ref. 26). This description profile
matches the inhibitory autophosphorylation that has been described for the alpha subunit of calcium/calmodulin-dependent
kinase II (α-CaMKII) at Thr305 and Thr306, which lowers the
affinity of CaMKII for CaM, and thus reduces Ca/CaM-mediated activation (27). β-CaMKII is expressed in Purkinje cells as
well (28), but the inhibitory autophosphorylation has only been
examined in α-CaMKII and has been shown to have a dominant
negative effect on the holoenzyme (27). Both α-CaMKII and
β-CaMKII are essential for proper LTD induction (28, 29).
CaMKII promotes LTD by suppressing the activity of protein
phosphatase 2A through negative regulation of phosphodiesterase 1 and subsequent disinhibition of a cGMP/protein kinase G pathway (30). Negative regulation of CaMKII by Thr305/
306 autophosphorylation requires prior calcium/calmodulin-mediated activation of CaMKII and subsequent calmodulin dissociation
(31). Moreover, it has been shown that Thr305/306 phosphorylation, triggered by 10-Hz priming, reduces hippocampal LTP (32),
whereas genetic manipulation of the Thr305/306 phosphorylation
site lowers the LTP threshold and prevents priming (27, 32). Thus,
CaMKII inhibitory autophosphorylation depends on previous calcium signaling and directly affects the kinase/phosphatase balance,
thus fulfilling the two requirements outlined above. To test whether
Thr305/306 phosphorylation is indeed involved in reducing the
probability for LTD induction at high stimulus frequencies,
we examined whether LTP is still induced by the 100-Hz PF
burst protocol, or whether LTD is restored, in α-CaMKII mutant
mice in which Thr305 and Thr306 are substituted by the nonphosphorylatable amino acids valine and alanine, respectively [referred to as TT305/6VA mice (27)]. In wild-type (WT) littermates,
application of the 100-Hz LTP protocol potentiated EPSC amplitudes (131.8 ± 12.4%; t = 36–40 min; n = 12; P = 0.026; Fig. 3B). In
contrast, application of the same protocol resulted in LTD in
TT305/6VA mice (81.5 ± 8.4%; n = 15; P = 0.044; Fig. 3B). The
difference between these groups was significant (P = 0.0021). We
next examined whether the same switch toward LTD occurs when
the 1-Hz LTP protocol is applied. In WT mice, single-pulse PF activation potentiated EPSC amplitudes (122.3 ± 4.3%; t = 36–40 min;
n = 7; P = 0.002; Fig. 3A). In TT305/6VA mice, LTP was
observed as well (124.9 ± 7.7%; n = 8; P = 0.007; group comparison: P = 0.42; Fig. 3A). Likewise, LTD was unaffected in TT305/
6VA mice, whether it was triggered by the 1-Hz protocol (WT:
72.8 ± 4.4%, t = 36–40 min, n = 8, P = 0.0005; TT305/6VA: 67.6 ±
3.0%, n = 5, P = 0.0004; group comparison: P = 0.38; Fig. S4A) or
the 100-Hz protocol (WT: 71.5 ± 5.0%, n = 6, P = 0.002; TT305/
6VA: 70.2 ± 5.3%, n = 5, P = 0.005; group comparison: P = 0.93;
Fig. S4B). We also tested LTD/LTP protocols in T305D mice, in
which Thr305 is replaced by a negatively charged Asp, which serves
as a phosphomimetic resembling persistent Thr305 phosphorylation
and preventing Ca/CaM binding (27). In slices prepared from T305D
mice, application of the 1-Hz LTD protocol and the 100-Hz LTD
protocol, respectively, resulted in LTP instead (1 Hz: 127.9 ± 10.2%,

t = 36–40 min, n = 6, P = 0.041; 100 Hz: 138.3 ± 12.4%, n = 7, P =
0.021; Fig. 4). These results are significantly different from the
respective LTD measures in WT controls (same as reported for the
TT305/6VA mice; 1-Hz group: P = 0.0019; 100-Hz group: P =
0.0027). LTP induction was not affected in T305D mice [1-Hz LTP:
136.3 ± 12.3%, n = 5, P = 0.018 compared with WT (P = 0.123);
100-Hz LTP: 134.0 ± 9.6, n = 6, P = 0.017 compared with WT (P =
0.93); Fig. S5]. These results suggest that high-frequency PF activation
causes CaMKII phosphorylation at Thr305/306, which blocks LTD
induction despite calcium levels above the threshold for 1-Hz LTD.
CF coactivation prevents inhibitory autophosphorylation and
restores LTD. However, LTD is not induced when CaMKII is
inactivated in a phosphomimetic mutant, which demonstrates the
existence of one (rather than multiple) threshold(s) for LTD induction that is regulated by the availability of CaMKII for activation.
Discussion
The observation that CF signaling promotes LTD regardless of
large variations in calcium signaling at different activation frequencies sheds light on the importance of instructive signals in
bidirectional plasticity and the way they operate. Our data show
that the LTD threshold slides, enabling the instructive CF signal
to operate over a wide frequency range by providing, at a given
frequency, a spine calcium transient that is higher than in the
absence of this signal (Fig. 5). The observation that the difference in the calcium signal amplitude caused by the switch in
activation frequency is larger than the difference resulting from
CF coactivation (Fig. 1) leads to the question of whether CF
activity indeed promotes LTD by amplifying calcium transients,
or whether it contributes other signaling factors that trigger the
switch toward LTD. For example, CF activity results in the release of corticotropin-releasing factor, which promotes LTD at
PF and CF synapses by activation of PKC (33, 34). In addition, in
the mature cerebellum, CF stimulation recruits a specific calcium
source that is not available at PF synapses, postsynaptically located NMDA receptors (7, 35, 36). It is conceivable that these
CF-specific signaling components contribute to LTD. However,
the BAPTA experiments demonstrate that a critical factor in the
switch from LTP to LTD is the local calcium signal amplitude,
which is significantly enhanced upon CF coactivation. A critical
prediction of this conclusion is that strong PF activation can
induce LTD in the absence of CF coactivation. This replacement
effect has indeed been demonstrated (37, 38, also ref. 39), suggesting that strong calcium influx, regardless of synaptic origin,
promotes LTD but that CF activity facilitates the induction
process by amplifying calcium transients.
The concept of synaptic modification under control of postsynaptic activity thresholds was introduced in the Bienenstock–
Cooper–Munro (BCM) theory, which was originally developed
as a model for developmental plasticity in the visual cortex (8). A
key assumption of the BCM theory is that the modification
threshold θM, which marks the level of postsynaptic activity at
which the polarity of synaptic plasticity changes from depression
to potentiation, is not fixed but, instead, may slide as a function
of synaptic activation history. Our data show that in the lowfrequency stimulus range, the [Ca2+]i threshold for LTD induction is ≤0.4 μM, whereas in the high-frequency range, it is
>3 μM. These values fall into the range of [Ca2+]i amplitudes
that have been reported as triggering LTD induction in the absence of synaptic activation (40, 41). Thus, these data demonstrate that the shift in the LTD threshold upon high-frequency
synaptic activation is a process that prevents the LTD that would
otherwise take place at the same [Ca2+]i levels. Previous reports
have assigned a key role for such threshold shifts to CaMKII. It
has been shown that CaMKII autophosphorylation at Thr286
shifts the threshold for hippocampal LTP to the right, thus facilitating LTD at potentiated synapses (42, also ref. 43). Moreover, it has been demonstrated that priming-induced Thr305/306
phosphorylation prevents subsequent LTP induction (32). In
these examples, threshold shifts follow prior synaptic activity;
thus, they constitute forms of metaplasticity as predicted by the
BCM rule. The threshold shift described here does not constitute
a classic form of metaplasticity [i.e., “plasticity of synaptic plasticity” (44)], because the LTD threshold does not shift as a
consequence of activity that occurred before stimulus protocol
application and separated by an activity-free interval from it but,
instead, results exclusively from sensing enhanced calcium levels

during stimulus application. Our finding that application of the
high-frequency LTP protocol in TT305/6VA mice induces LTD
instead, whereas the same polarity switch is not observed when
using the low-frequency LTP protocol, suggests that inhibitory
autophosphorylation of CaMKII selectively occurs upon highfrequency PF stimulation but is overcome by CF coactivation. Not
much is known about the biochemical requirements for Thr305/
306 autophosphorylation or its prevention. It has been shown
that Thr305/306 autophosphorylation requires Ca/CaM binding to
CaMKII and subsequent dissociation (31). A possible, but not
experimentally tested, scenario is that repeated 100-Hz PF bursts
provide the calcium influx required for Ca/CaM binding to CaMKII,
but that during the pauses between the bursts, which last almost 1 s,
CaM dissociates from CaMKII, allowing inhibitory phosphorylation
to take place. Single PF pulses (1-Hz LTP protocol) do not seem to
provide sufficient calcium to trigger Ca/CaM binding to CaMKII.
Conversely, the larger calcium transient that results from paired
100-Hz PF burst + CF activation might provide sufficient calcium
to prevent CaM dissociation, thus allowing CaMKII to remain in
the activated state.
The frequency-dependent calcium threshold shift described here
might also explain why it has been difficult to confirm the existence
of distinct calcium thresholds for LTD and LTP induction using
photolysis of caged calcium compounds (40, 45). In the absence of
synaptic activity, the thresholds might assume different, possibly
overlapping, values, and additional parameters, such as the involvement of specific calcium sources/sensors, might gain importance. The latter possibility has been demonstrated in cortical
pyramidal cells, in which larger calcium transients are needed for
LTP than for LTD induction, but activation of metabotropic glutamate receptors provides a switch for LTD. Blockade of this switch
allows for LTP induction if the calcium signals reach the higher
LTP threshold (14). An important aspect of calcium amplitude
thresholds is that they can vary with the duration of calcium exposure. Using calcium uncaging experiments, for example, it has
been shown that lower calcium amplitudes are sufficient for cerebellar LTD induction if they are presented for longer periods of
time (40). Note that our data do not contradict this “leaky integrator” model. Rather, we kept the overall duration of the tetanization period constant (all stimulus patterns were applied at
1 Hz for 5 min) to study the shift in LTP/LTD induction probabilities that specifically results from a variation in the synaptic
activation frequency alone. A consequence of calcium thresholds
that shift depending on stimulus conditions, such as variations in
duration or frequency, is that threshold values do not generalize,
but only apply to very specific activation conditions. For this reason,
we only report peak [Ca2+
]i values for protocol-typical individual
stimuli (Fig. 5), but otherwise describe relations between threshold
amplitudes. Our findings have important implications for the control of activity-dependent synaptic plasticity by dendritic calcium
transients. The study identifies a fundamental problem that synapses have to solve when enabling LTD and LTP under control of
an instructive signal, but independent of the induction frequency:
Spine calcium transients reach different amplitudes at different
activation frequencies. At PF-Purkinje cell synapses, this problem is
solved by a shift of the LTD threshold upon Thr305/306 phosphorylation of CaMKII, allowing for LTD/LTP induction independent of absolute calcium levels, but under control of relative
calcium thresholds.
Materials and Methods
Animals. All procedures were performed in accordance with the guidelines of
the University of Chicago’s Animal Care and Use Committee. Experiments
were performed using P21-75 mice (C57BL/6). In some experiments, we used
P21-75 TT305/6VA or T305D mutant mice and WT littermate controls, which
are also in a congenic C57BL/6 background (27).
Slice Preparation. Animals were anesthetized with isoflurane and decapitated. The cerebellar vermis was removed and cooled in artificial cerebrospinal fluid (ACSF) containing 124 mM NaCl, 5 mM KCl, 1.25 mM Na2HPO4,
2 mM CaCl2, 2 mM MgSO4, 26 mM NaHCO3, and 10 mM D-glucose, bubbled
with 95% (vol%) O2 and 5% (vol%) CO2. Parasagittal slices of the cerebellar
vermis (200 μm) were prepared using a Leica VT-1000S vibratome, and were
subsequently kept for at least 1 h at room temperature in oxygenated ACSF.
Throughout recording, slices were perfused with ACSF that was supplemented with picrotoxin (100 μM) to block GABAA receptors.
Whole-Cell Patch-Clamp Recordings. Patch-clamp recordings from the Purkinje
cell soma were performed at room temperature using an EPC-10 amplifier
(HEKA Electronics). Currents were filtered at 3 kHz, digitized at 25 kHz, and
acquired using Patchmaster software (HEKA Electronics). Patch pipettes (2–5 MΩ)
were filled with a solution containing 9 mM KCl, 10 mM KOH, 120 mM
K-gluconate, 3.48 mM MgCl2, 10 mM Hepes, 4 mM NaCl, 4 mM Na2ATP,
0.4 mM Na3GTP, and 17.5 mM sucrose (osmolarity: 295–305 mmol/kg,
pH 7.25). In two groups of experiments, 5 and 20 mM BAPTA (tetrapotassium salt) was added to the internal saline. In the BAPTA experiments, CaCl2
was added (2.5 and 10 mM) to maintain the resting calcium concentration
(46). To evoke synaptic responses, PFs and CFs were activated using glass electrodes filled with ACSF. In the LTD and LTP experiments (Figs. 2–4 and Figs.
S3–S5), test responses were recorded in voltage-clamp mode before and
after application of the induction protocol at a frequency of 0.05 Hz. Tetanization was applied in current-clamp mode. Series and input resistances
were monitored by applying hyperpolarizing voltage steps (−10 mV) at the
end of each sweep. Recordings were excluded if series or input resistances
varied by >15% over the course of the experiments.
Confocal Calcium Imaging. Calcium transients were monitored using a Zeiss
LSM 5 Exciter confocal microscope equipped with a 63× Apochromat objective (Carl Zeiss MicroImaging). Calcium signals were calculated as ΔG/R =
(G(t) − G0)/R (22), where G is the calcium-sensitive fluorescence (G0 = baseline signal) of either OGB-2 (200 μM), Fluo-5F (300 μM), or OGB-5N (300 μM)
and R is the calcium-insensitive fluorescence of Alexa 633 (30 μM). Using
G/R values from the Fluo-5F measurements, peak [Ca2+]i was estimated by
calculating (22)

which is analogous to the equation (47)

where R is the ratio of the fluorescence intensities F1 and F2 of a dualwavelength indicator (e.g., fura-2) at excitation wavelengths λ1 and λ2, respectively. For Fluo-5F, G/Rmax (1.57) was measured in dye-filled Purkinje
cells. To obtain maximal calcium signal amplitudes, the CF input was tetanized at 100 Hz in ACSF containing 4 mM CaCl2. G/Rmin (0.0026) was

Fig. 5. Sliding plasticity thresholds and role of CaMKII inhibitory autophosphorylation. (A) Schematic presents a model of the relationship between calcium amplitudes and LTD/LTP as assessed in this study (the dashed
lines indicate that possible LTP thresholds were not investigated). The
numbers below show approximations of peak [Ca2+]i values, which were
calculated from ΔG/R measures recorded at each stimulus condition. Note
that these peak values were determined from individual protocol-typical
stimuli, and not from complete stimulus trains (Fig. S6). [Ca2+]i values are not
presented for the low-amplitude signals (N.D.), because no reliable measures
above noise could be obtained with the low-affinity indicator Fluo-5F.
(B) Diagram showing the role of CaMKII in LTD induction. CaMKII indirectly
promotes LTD (dashed arrow) by negative regulation of phosphodiesterase
1 (PDE1), and the resulting facilitation of a cGMP/protein kinase G (PKG)
cascade, which ultimately removes a blockade of LTD induction pathways by
protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A) (also ref. 30). Inhibitory autophosphorylation
of CaMKII at Thr305/306 may disable this negative regulation of PP2A.

determined in cuvettes using a solution containing 0 mM [Ca2+
], supplemented
with 10 mM K2EGTA. The Kd values for all dyes were determined using cuvette
measurements of solutions prepared from a calcium calibration buffer kit
(Molecular Probes). The green fluorescence G resulted from excitation at 488 nm
using an argon laser. The red fluorescence R resulted from excitation at 633 nm
using a HeNe laser (both from Lasos Lasertechnik). Purkinje cells were loaded
with the dyes through diffusion from the patch pipette. The experiments were
performed at room temperature and were initiated after the fluorescence at the
selected dendritic ROI reached a steady-state level, which typically required
≥30 min. In each recording, the ROI was the spine on a secondary (or higher
order) dendritic branch in the field of view close to the stimulus electrode that
responded maximally to synaptic activation. The maximally responding spine
was selected to ensure comparability between the calcium measures in different
neurons. The strategy to focus on protocol-typical stimulus units, rather than
measuring calcium levels during the entire tetanization period (5 min), was
chosen to be able to test all four stimulus conditions in the same Purkinje cell.
This strategy would not be possible with the application of complete protocols,
which trigger either LTD or LTP, and would thus affect subsequent measures.
This approach is validated in control experiments (Fluo-5F) that show there is
no calcium build-up between stimuli over the course of 5-min periods of
tetanization, not even when the high-frequency LTD protocol is applied (Fig. S6).
Image acquisition was restricted to the first 2 s of each beginning minute of
ongoing stimulation to reduce the amount of phototoxicity. This strategy
allowed us to monitor baseline and peak calcium levels during tetanization
while minimizing transient calcium build-up that may result from prolonged
light exposure [compare with studies that focused on capturing the complete
calcium profile during ongoing tetanization (48, 49)]. Our recordings show that
under these imaging conditions, baseline calcium levels do not plateau.
Data Analysis. Data were analyzed using Patchmaster software (HEKA Electronics) and Igor Pro software (Wavemetrics). Imaging data were analyzed
using ZEN software (Carl Zeiss MicroImaging). Statistical significance was
determined by using the paired Student’s t test (within-group comparison of
paired events) and the Mann–Whitney U test (between-group comparison),
when appropriate. All data are shown as mean ± SEM.
