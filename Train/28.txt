Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome protein (WASP) family verprolin homologous protein 1 (WAVE1) regulates actin-related protein 2/3 (Arp2/3)
complex-mediated actin polymerization. Our previous studies have
found WAVE1 to be inhibited by Cdk5-mediated phosphorylation
in brain and to play a role in the regulation of dendritic spine morphology. Here we report that mice in which WAVE1 was knocked out
(KO) in neurons expressing the D1 dopamine receptor (D1-KO), but
not mice where WAVE1 was knocked out in neurons expressing the
D2 dopamine receptor (D2-KO), exhibited a significant decrease in
place preference associated with cocaine. In contrast to wild-type
(WT) and WAVE1 D2-KO mice, cocaine-induced sensitized locomotor
behavior was not maintained in WAVE1 D1-KO mice. After chronic
cocaine administration and following withdrawal, an acute cocaine
challenge induced WAVE1 activation in striatum, which was assessed
by dephosphorylation. The cocaine-induced WAVE1 dephosphorylation was attenuated by coadministration of either a D1 dopamine
receptor or NMDA glutamate receptor antagonist. Upon an acute
challenge of cocaine following chronic cocaine exposure and withdrawal, we also observed in WT, but not in WAVE1 D1-KO mice, a
decrease in dendritic spine density and a decrease in the frequency of
excitatory postsynaptic AMPA receptor currents in medium spiny
projection neurons expressing the D1 dopamine receptor (D1-MSNs)
in the nucleus accumbens. These results suggest that WAVE1 is
involved selectively in D1-MSNs in cocaine-evoked neuronal activitymediated feedback regulation of glutamatergic synapses.

Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome protein (WASP) family verprolin
homologous protein (WAVE) initiates de novo actin polymerization through its ability to activate the actin-related protein 2/3
(Arp2/3) complex (1). Three members of the family (WAVE1–3)
exist, with WAVE1 being highly expressed in brain (2). WAVE1
was purified from bovine or rat brain as part of a heteropentameric
protein complex together with PIR121 [also called cytoplasmic
FMR1-interacting protein 2, (Cyfip2)], Nck-associated protein 1
(Nckap1), Abl-interactor 2 (Abi2), and HSPC300 (3, 4). Whereas
WAVE1 plays a key role in Arp2/3 complex binding and actin
polymerization, other protein components in the complex are important for its subcellular localization and interaction with upstream
ligands or activators (5, 6).
In our initial study in striatum, the WAVE1 complex was found
to interact with p35, the regulatory subunit of cyclin-dependent
kinase 5 (Cdk5) (4). Phosphorylation of WAVE1 at Ser310, Ser397,
and Ser441 by Cdk5/p35, in the complex purified from rat brain, or
with recombinant WAVE1, resulted in inhibition of actin polymerization in vitro (4). We also observed that the stoichiometry of
WAVE1 phosphorylation by Cdk5 is high in brain, suggestive of the
protein being largely inactive under basal conditions (4). However,
studies using mouse striatal slices indicated that WAVE1 can be
dephosphorylated at all three Cdk5 sites and thereby activated
upon stimulation of D1 dopamine and of NMDA glutamate receptors, acting through cAMP- and Ca2+
-mediated activation of
protein phosphatase 2A and 2B, respectively (4, 7). These results
indicate that WAVE1 is a neuronal activity-regulated phosphoprotein in the striatum.
We previously identified a pivotal role for Cdk5/p35 in cocaineinduced adaptive changes in brain (8). Cocaine is a highly addictive
psychostimulant that exerts its effects on brain reward regions such
as the nucleus accumbens (NAc), a ventral part of the striatum (9–
11). The NAc receives dopaminergic input from the ventral tegmental area (VTA) and glutamatergic inputs from the medial
prefrontal cortex (mPFC), hippocampus, and amygdala, among
other regions (12). Cocaine elevates synaptic levels of dopamine by
blocking reuptake of dopamine into presynaptic terminals (13, 14).
However, chronic exposure to cocaine dampens dopamine signaling
through increases in ΔFosB and Cdk5/p35 (8). Cdk5/p35 phosphorylates Thr75 of DARPP-32, a master regulator of dopamine
signaling in striatal medium spiny projection neurons (MSNs), and
thereby negatively regulates DARPP-32 function (15). Chronic
exposure to cocaine also changes glutamatergic synapses in the
Significance
Cocaine-induced synaptic plasticity in the nucleus accumbens is
implicated in neural adaptations that underlie addiction. Here
we demonstrate that Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome protein (WASP)
family verprolin homologous protein 1 (WAVE1) plays a selective
role in medium spiny projection neurons that express D1 dopamine receptors (D1-MSNs) in the cellular and behavioral actions
of cocaine. Our results suggest that chronic exposure to cocaine,
followed by withdrawal, potentiates the signaling capacity of
D1 dopamine and NMDA glutamate receptors, allowing WAVE1
activation in response to an acute cocaine challenge. WAVE1
activation is associated with morphological and functional decreases in glutamatergic synapses on D1-MSNs. Thus, we propose that WAVE1 is involved in a negative feedback mechanism
of regulation of glutamatergic synapses as a part of the process
of cocaine-induced synaptic plasticity.

NAc, including increasing dendritic spine density (9, 10, 16, 17). We
showed that a Cdk5 inhibitor attenuated baseline dendritic spine
density as well as cocaine-induced dendritic spine outgrowth in
NAc core and shell, suggesting an involvement of Cdk5 in the
regulation of dendritic spine density (18). WAVE1 is also known to
regulate dendritic spine morphology (4). In the present study, we
investigated the function of WAVE1 in the cellular and behavioral
responses to cocaine. We found a critical role of WAVE1 expressed
in a subpopulation of MSNs in cocaine-induced feedback regulation of dendritic spine density, maintenance of cocaine-induced
locomotor sensitization, and cocaine reward.
Results
Expression of WAVE1 in D1- and D2-MSNs and Generation of CellType–Specific WAVE1 KO Mice. The WAVE1 complex is highly
expressed in the forebrain, including cerebral cortex, hippocampus,
striatum, and thalamus, and this expression pattern is well correlated
with that of p35 (Fig. S1A) (2). MSNs, the major neuronal type in the
striatum, are largely segregated into two distinct subpopulations
expressing high levels of either dopamine D1 receptor (D1) or D2
receptor (D2) (19–21). We used bacterial artificial chromosome
(BAC) transgenic mice expressing EGFP under the control of D1
(Drd1) or D2 (Drd2) promoters and examined the expression of
WAVE1 and EGFP in D1- and D2-MSNs. Similar levels of WAVE1
immunostaining were observed in both D1- and D2-MSNs (Fig. S1 B
and C). Anatomically, D1-MSNs and D2-MSNs in dorsal striatum
project to distinct brain areas (22) but projections of D1-MSNs and
D2-MSNs from the NAc are more overlapping and remain to be
further defined (11, 23). Importantly, stimulation of MSNs by dopamine results in opposite regulation of cAMP and PKA via stimulatory G protein (Gs/Golf)-mediated signaling in D1-MSNs compared
with inhibitory G protein (Gi
/Go)-mediated signaling in D2-MSNs
(24). Furthermore, molecular manipulations of D1-MSNs or D2-
MSNs results in distinct behavioral effects of drugs of abuse (24).
Thus, we decided to generate cell-type–selective KO lines to more
specifically investigate WAVE1 function.
Previously we generated mice in which exon 4 of the WAVE1
gene was flanked by loxP sites (25). We bred floxed WAVE1 with
either Drd1 or Drd2 promoter-driven Cre-recombinase lines (26)
to delete WAVE1 in neurons expressing D1 (D1-KO) or D2 (D2-
KO) receptors (Fig. S2A). WAVE1 protein in striatal lysates was
reduced in both D1- and D2-KO mice, with a greater reduction
being found in D1-KO mice (∼40% versus ∼17% of reduction)
(Fig. S2B). Previous studies of Drd1-EGFP or Drd2-EGFP mice
have indicated a comparable number of D1-MSNs and D2-MSNs
(∼50% of neurons as Drd1-EGFP+ versus ∼40% of neurons as
Drd2-EGFP+
) (27). The reason for the greater reduction in total
striatal WAVE1 in the D1-KO mice is therefore unclear, but could
reflect higher expression of WAVE1 in D1-MSNs compared with
that in D2-MSNs. We also used a Cre-recombinase–dependent
tdTomato reporter line and confirmed that WAVE1 deletion was
selectively dependent on Drd1-promoter–driven Cre-recombinase
activity (Fig. S2C).
Role for WAVE1 in D1-MSNs in Cocaine-Induced Behavior. We used
noncontingent cocaine administration (cocaine administration by
experimenter) and assessed cocaine reward in a conditioned place
preference (CPP) test. WAVE1 D1-KO mice showed a significantly reduced CPP score in both a standard CPP test (Fig. 1A) and
a sensitization CPP test (Fig. 1C) compared with WT mice. In
contrast, WAVE1 D2-KO mice did not show any significant difference compared with WT mice in either of the CPP tests (Fig. 1
B and D), suggesting a selective role for WAVE1 in D1-neurons in
cocaine reward.
We next investigated the effect of cocaine on locomotor sensitization using WAVE1 D1-KO or D2-KO mice and their corresponding WT controls. WAVE1 D1-KO mice and D2-KO mice both
developed locomotor sensitization during chronic administration of
cocaine (Fig. 1 E and F). However, after 2 or 3 wk of drug withdrawal, D1-KO mice showed a lower response to subsequent acute
cocaine administration (Fig. 1E). D2-KO mice responded the same
as WT mice to a cocaine challenge following withdrawal (Fig. 1F).
These results suggest further that WAVE1 in neurons expressing the
D1 receptor is required for the enduring effects of cocaine as measured by CPP and locomotion sensitization tests.
Regulation of WAVE1 Phosphorylation by Cocaine. Previously, our
studies showed that stimulation of striatal slices with a D1 agonist
or NMDA led to dephosphorylation of WAVE1 at Ser310, Ser397,
and Ser441, indicating neuronal activity-mediated stimulation of
WAVE1 (4, 7). We anticipated that WAVE1 would be dephosphorylated in response to cocaine administration in vivo, because
cocaine increases synaptic levels of dopamine, and activation of D1
is known to increase NMDA-receptor–mediated signaling (13, 28,
29). However, there was no significant change in phosphorylation,
or of the total protein level, of WAVE1 in the striatum in response
to acute injection of cocaine (45 min after 15 mg/kg) or chronic
injection of cocaine (15 mg/kg daily for 14 d; 45 min after the last
injection). Instead, we found that WAVE1 was significantly
dephosphorylated at all three sites in response to an acute challenge with cocaine following chronic cocaine administration and a
subsequent 14-d withdrawal period (Fig. 2). We did not see any
significant change in total protein levels of WAVE1, p35, or Cdk5
(Fig. S3 A–C). Coinjection of a D1 antagonist (SCH23390) or an
NMDA-receptor antagonist (MK801) with the acute cocaine
challenge largely blocked the dephosphorylation of WAVE1 (Fig. 3

KO mice. (A and B) Cocaine-associated place preference in D1-KO mice (A) or

which cocaine was administered (15 mg/kg) for 7 consecutive days followed by a
5-d withdrawal (WD). Preference for a low dose of cocaine (5 mg/kg) was then
assessed: WT versus D1-KO mice [t15 = 2.271, *P < 0.05, n = 7 (WT), 10 (D1-KO)]
and WT versus D2-KO mice [n = 8 (WT), 8 (D2-KO)]. (E and F) WT mice and

Cocaine (10 mg/kg, i.p.) was administered for 10 consecutive days. After chronic
cocaine administration, WT and D1-KO mice were divided into two groups (n =
8 per group) and subjected to 2-wk or 3-wk WD (E), whereas WT and D2-KO
mice were subjected to only a 2-wk WD (n = 11 per group) (F). Acute cocaine
challenge (10 mg/kg) was administered following the 2-wk (day 25) or 3-wk WD
(day 32). Locomotion was measured daily for 1 h after saline, cocaine (days 1–5),
or acute cocaine challenge. Data represent means ± SEM. WT versus D1-KO

Role for WAVE1 in Cocaine-Induced Changes in Dendritic Spine
Morphology. Plasticity of glutamatergic transmission in the NAc
has emerged as a major contributing factor for addictive behavior (9,
10, 17). Previous studies showed that chronic administration of cocaine increases dendritic spine density in D1-MSNs (30–32). Dendritic spines are the postsynaptic part of glutamatergic synapses and
actin polymerization is highly implicated in spine morphogenesis
and stability (33, 34). Because WAVE1 plays a role in the regulation
of dendritic spine morphology (4) and cocaine-induced behavior is
altered in WAVE1 D1-KO mice (Fig. 1), we examined a possible
role for WAVE1 in chronic cocaine-induced increase of spine
density in D1-MSNs. We injected WT and WAVE1 D1-KO mice
daily with saline or cocaine (15 mg/kg) for 14 d. Two days after the
last injection, dendritic spine morphology of D1-MSNs was analyzed. We quantified total dendritic protrusions and also four classes
of dendritic spines based on their length (35, 36). Class 1 represents
stubby spines without a discernible neck, classes 2 and 3 represent
short and long spines, respectively, and class 4 represents filopodial
protrusions. In response to cocaine, we observed a comparable increase in the density of total spines and class 2 spines in the NAc
core of WT or WAVE1 D1-KO mice (Fig. 4). The effect of chronic
cocaine on dendritic spines in the NAc shell was relatively minimal
in this experiment (Fig. S4). Our results suggest that WAVE1 is not
required for the chronic cocaine-induced increase in dendritic spine
density in D1-MSNs observed under these conditions.
We next investigated possible changes in dendritic spines after
an acute challenge with cocaine following withdrawal because
WAVE1 dephosphorylation was observed under this condition
(Fig. 2). Notably, an acute challenge with cocaine reduced total
spine density in D1-MSNs in the WT NAc core but no decrease
was found in D1-MSNs in WAVE1 KO NAc core (Fig. 5). The
decrease in total spine density in WT mice was due to a decrease in
spine density in classes 1–3 spines, whereas an opposing direction of
spine changes in classes 1 and 2 was observed in WAVE1 D1-KO
mice (Fig. 5). We also observed an acute cocaine-challenge–
induced decrease in total and class 3 spine density in D1-MSNs in
the NAc shell but the decrease was not observed in WAVE1 KO
D1-MSNs in the NAc shell (Fig. S5).
To examine the potential physiological consequences of a decrease in spine density in the NAc core, we examined AMPA
glutamate receptor currents in this region. Consistently, acute
cocaine challenge following withdrawal caused a significant reduction in frequency but not in amplitude of AMPA currents in
WT mice (Fig. 6). This effect of cocaine on AMPA current frequency was abolished in WAVE1 D1-KO mice, supporting a
critical role for WAVE1 in the decrease of functional glutamatergic synapses on D1-MSNs under these conditions (Fig. 6).
Discussion
In this study, we identified a role for WAVE1 in cocaine reward
and maintenance of locomotor sensitization. Using selective KO of
WAVE1, we found decreased cocaine CPP and maintenance of
locomotor sensitization in mice lacking WAVE1 in D1-expressing
neurons. In contrast, mice lacking WAVE1 in D2-expressing neurons showed normal behavioral responses to cocaine. We also found
a role for WAVE1 in the regulation of dendritic spine density in D1-
MSNs in NAc in response to an acute challenge of cocaine following
chronic cocaine exposure and 2 wk of withdrawal. This finding was
associated with a decrease in the frequency of excitatory postsynaptic AMPA receptor currents in D1-MSNs. In further support
of a selective role of WAVE1 in D1-mediated signaling, we found
that following the acute challenge of cocaine in conjuction with
chronic cocaine administration and withdrawal, cocaine-induced
WAVE1 dephosphorylation was attenuated by coadministration
of a D1 or an NMDA glutamate receptor antagonist.
Our previous studies indicated that WAVE1 is phosphorylated
to a high level by Cdk5/p35 and as a result is largely inactive under
basal conditions (4). Chronic cocaine exposure increases the levels
of Cdk5 and p35 in the striatum (8). Increased levels of Cdk5/p35
phosphorylate DARPP-32 at Thr75 and reduce the efficacy of
dopamine/cAMP/PKA/DARPP-32/protein phosphatase-1 signaling (8, 15). Cdk5/p35 also regulates the NR2B subunit of NMDA
receptors by direct interaction and phosphorylation at Ser1116,
resulting in facilitation of degradation of NR2B by calpain and
inhibition of surface expression, respectively (37, 38). Thus, chronic
cocaine-induced Cdk5/p35 expression would be expected to
maintain WAVE1 in an inactive state through direct inhibitory
phosphorylation as well as through inhibition of D1 and NMDA
receptor signaling, which are the major pathways for WAVE1 activation (7). Consistent with this interpretation, WAVE1 was not
required for the development of locomotor sensitization or for the

increase of dendritic spine density observed following chronic exposure to cocaine. Instead, WAVE1 was dephosphorylated after an
acute challenge of cocaine following chronic cocaine plus withdrawal, in a D1 and NMDA receptor signaling-dependent manner.
Our previous studies showed that D1/cAMP/PKA signaling or
NMDA receptor/calcium signaling leads to dephosphorylation and
activation of WAVE1 (4, 7). Stimulation of D1 increases but
stimulation of D2 decreases cAMP/PKA signaling (24). Furthermore, stimulation of D1 facilitates, whereas stimulation of D2 attenuates NMDA-mediated calcium responses in MSNs (39, 40).
Thus, WAVE1 in D1-MSNs but not in D2-MSNs would be activated in response to cocaine. This biochemical activation mechanism likely underlies the selective role for WAVE1 in D1-MSNs in
cellular and behavioral responses to cocaine observed in this study.
In this study, we used a noncontingent cocaine administration
paradigm involving chronic cocaine administration, withdrawal, and
acute challenge of cocaine. In this paradigm, we were able to observe preserved sensitization of cocaine reward (measured by CPP)
and sensitization of locomotor activity. Following withdrawal from
chronic cocaine exposure, morphological and functional plasticity
of glutamatergic synapses in the NAc has been suggested as a
critical mechanism underlying cocaine craving and relapse (10, 11).
Strengthening of excitatory synapses in MSNs in the NAc involves
the initial formation of silent synapses lacking AMPA receptors
during chronic exposure to cocaine, followed by insertion of AMPA
receptors into spines during withdrawal (9–11). Accumulating evidence indicates that adaptive cocaine action involves potentiation
of glutamatergic afferents arising from mPFC, amygdala, and
ventral hippocampus preferentially onto D1-MSNs (41–44), although D2-MSNs still contribute to certain behavioral features of
cocaine action (45, 46). Previous studies showed that WAVE1 is
highly localized to dendritic spines (47). WAVE1 KO neurons had
decreased dendritic spine density, suggesting a role for WAVE1 in
dendritic spine formation (4, 47). In the current study, we also
observed lower baseline dendritic spine density in WAVE1 D1-KO
MSNs compared with WT MSNs. However, WAVE1 was dispensable for chronic cocaine-induced spine formation. Instead,
WAVE1 was required for a selective decrease in spine density in
D1-MSNs in response to a cocaine challenge following withdrawal
from chronic cocaine. We also observed that cocaine challenge
decreased the frequency in AMPA currents in D1-MSNs in a
WAVE1-dependent manner, supporting a role for WAVE1 in the
pruning of glutamatergic synapses. Thus, our previous and current
results together implicate WAVE1 in mediating distinct aspects of
morphological plasticity that depend on the stage of spine development and the strength of input signals.
The dopamine system is intricately connected with the glutamatergic system in responses to acute and chronic exposure to
cocaine. Dopaminergic neurons in the VTA provide dopaminergic
input to NAc and mPFC and receive glutamatergic input from
several corticolimbic structures such as mPFC, amygdala, and
hippocampus (48–50). Glutamatergic input to the VTA increases
the activity of dopaminergic neurons and enhances dopamine release in NAc (51–53). Dopamine also affects glutamatergic transmission by increasing the firing probability in pyramidal neurons in
mPFC (54). The interactions of these two neurotransmitter systems
in the VTA and mPFC might be involved in the increased glutamate release in the NAc observed after repeated cocaine administration (55, 56). Glutamate transmission in the NAc plays a key
role in cocaine addiction, which is predominantly mediated by
AMPA receptors in MSNs (17, 41, 57, 58). The synaptic strength of
AMPA receptors in MSNs is also modulated by intracellular dopamine signaling. Cocaine-activated D1/cAMP/PKA signaling
leads to phosphorylation of AMPA receptors and primes them for
synaptic insertion (59, 60). The WAVE1-regulated decrease of
glutamatergic synapses on D1-MSNs in NAc in response to cocaine
challenge following withdrawal might be part of a homeostatic
feedback mechanism to avoid excessive increases in excitatory input
and to thereby maintain network stability (61, 62). It is also possible
that WAVE1-mediated synaptic pruning is input specific. Recent
studies indicate that cocaine-evoked plasticity in NAc specifically in
glutamatergic afferents from mPFC onto D1-MSNs mediates correct action-outcome selection during cocaine seeking, whereas cocaine-evoked plasticity specifically in glutamatergic afferents from
ventral hippocampus onto D1-MSNs mediates recognition of the
correct context where cocaine can be obtained (41). It will be

important to identify specific afferents regulated by WAVE1 and
behavioral consequence of WAVE1-mediated synaptic plasticity.
Cyfip2 (PIR121) is a component of the WAVE1 complex, which
we isolated as a Cdk5/p35 binding protein from the striatum (4).
Recently, genetic screening of C57BL/6 substrains identified the
Cyfip2 gene mutation S968F as a causative variant for different
acute and sensitized locomotor responses to cocaine (63). Another
genetic study of BXD mouse strains also identified Cyfip2 as a
candidate gene underlying a different intake response in i.v. cocaine
self-administration (64). As in the case of the mouse Cyfip2 S968F
variant providing a differential cocaine response in mouse substrains (63), certain polymorphisms in WAVE1 complex proteins in
humans might contribute to vulnerability in functional plasticity of
glutamatergic synapses underlying addiction behavior such as cocaine craving and relapse. Characterization of WAVE1 mouse
models using drug self-administration to measure clinically relevant
drug craving and compulsive drug taking behavior (10, 65, 66),
together with further understanding WAVE1-mediated synaptic
plasticity in D1-MSNs, will be important topics for future research.
Methods
Animals and Treatments. All procedures involving animals were approved by
The Rockefeller University Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee and
were performed in accordance with National Institutes of Health guidelines.
BAC transgenic Drd1a-EGFP, Drd2-EGFP, Drd1a-Cre, and Drd2-Cre were from
GENSAT (The Rockefeller University) (26, 67). A floxed WAVE1 line (25) was
crossed with Drd1a-Cre (EY262) or Drd2-Cre (ER44) mouse lines. A double
transgenic line harboring floxed WAVE1 and Drd1a-Cre alleles was crossed
with a tdTomato reporter line (The Jackson Laboratory, 007909). Progeny were
produced using in vitro fertilization and embryo-transfer techniques to generate the animals needed for the biochemical and behavioral tests. Cocaine
(Sigma-Aldrich) was administered by i.p. injection.
Immunohistochemistry. Mouse perfusion, preparation of brain slices, and
immunohistochemistry were performed as described (30, 36). Anti-GFP
(rabbit polyclonal, 1:1,000; Abcam), anti-WAVE1 (rabbit polyclonal, 1:1,000;
V0101) (68) and anti-enkephalin (clone: NOC1, 1:250; Millipore) were used.
Locomotor Behavior. WT, WAVE1 D1-KO, and D2-KO mice (12–16 wk of age)
were habituated to saline injection (i.p.) for 2 consecutive days and then they
received injections of cocaine (i.p. 10 mg/kg) for 10 consecutive days. WT and
WAVE1 D1-KO mice were then divided into two groups: one group for 2-wk
withdrawal and the other group for 3-wk withdrawal. After 2-wk or 3-wk
withdrawal, mice received a challenge of cocaine (i.p. 10 mg/kg) to test the
maintenance of sensitized locomotor activity. In the case of WAVE1 D2-KO mice
and their WT mice, following a 2-wk withdrawal, mice received a challenge of
cocaine (i.p. 10 mg/kg). Locomotor activity was measured daily in an open field
chamber (42 × 42 × 30.5 cm) for 60 min after saline treatments, chronic cocaine
treatments (first 5 d), and acute challenge with cocaine. Automated Accuscan
software (Gerber Technology) was used to calculate total distance traveled.
Conditioned Place Preference. CPP was carried out in a three-chambered box
and a pretest, which preceded all training sessions, was performed as described
previously (69). During 30-min training sessions in which partitions between end
chambers were lowered, mice received two saline and two cocaine injections on
2 consecutive days (saline in the morning and cocaine in the afternoon) in
opposite end chambers. One day after training, CPP was assessed during a
training session in which all partitions between chambers were raised, mice
were placed in the middle chamber, and time spent in individual chambers was
monitored during a 20-min session. The testing session preference score was
calculated as time spent in the cocaine-paired end chamber minus time spent in
the saline-paired end chamber. For normal CPP tests (nonsensitization) a 7.5 mg/kg
cocaine dose (i.p.) was used during the training session. For sensitization CPP
experiments, mice were injected i.p. with a 15-mg/kg cocaine dose one
time per day for 7 consecutive days in their home cage. This dosing was
followed by a 5-d withdrawal period in which no cocaine was given. Mice
were then injected with a low cocaine dose (5 mg/kg) for the sensitization
CPP training sessions.
Phosphorylation Analysis and Immunoblotting. Saline- or cocaine-injected mice
were killed by focused microwave irradiation of the brain (model: TMW-6402C,
Muromachi Kikai). The killing of rodents by microwave irradiation results in
rapid protein denaturation, effectively protecting phosphorylated proteins
from postmortem activity of protein phosphatases (70). Preparation of brain
lysates, BCA protein assay, and immunoblotting using the Odyssey infrared
imaging system (Licor) were done as described (7). Antibodies for total WAVE1,
phosphorylation site-specific WAVE1, PIR121, Nckap1, Abi2, p35, and Cdk5
were used as described (4).
Dendritic Spine Analysis. Perfusion of mouse brain, preparation of brain slices, and
labeling brain slices with the lipophilic fluorescence dye 1,1′-diotadecyl-3,3,3′,3′-
tetramethylindocarbocyanine perchlorate (DiI) were performed as described (30,
36). Fluorescent dendritic images of MSNs were taken using a confocal microscope
(Zeiss LSM 710) with an oil immersion lens (EC Plan-Neofluar 100×, 1.4 N.A.). DiI
was excited using an Argon 514-nm laser line. A filterless scanhead was used for
emission collection. Images of distal dendrites (second to fourth order dendrites)
were examined in this study. For dendritic spines, a stack of images was acquired
in the z dimension with an optical slice thickness of 0.4 μm (with oversampling).
The pixel sizes along x and y dimensions were both 0.06 μm (with oversampling).
To identify D1-MSNs, enkephalin was immnunostained and dendritic spine images were acquired from enkephalin− cells (D1-MSNs). All measurements were
made manually with Metamorph image analysis software (Universal Imaging
Corporation). Protrusions from dendrites were classified into four types based on
their length as described (35, 36). Class 1 protrusions (also called stubby) were less
than 0.5 μm, lacked a large spine head, and did not appear to have a neck; class 2,
or shorter spines, were between 0.5 and 1.25 μm long; class 3, or longer spines,
ranged between 1.25 and 3.0 μm; and class 4, or filopodial extensions, were filamentous protrusions longer than 3.0 μm.
Electrophysiological Analysis. WT and WAVE1 D1-KO mice expressing Drd1-
promoter–driven tdTomato were injected i.p. with a 15 mg/kg cocaine dose per
day for 14 consecutive days. This dose was followed by a 14-d withdrawal and
then an acute challenge of either saline or cocaine (5 mg/kg). Coronal slices
were prepared from WT and WAVE1 D1-KO mice following procedures approved by the Northwestern University Animal Care and Use Committee, as
described (62). Patch pipettes (3–4 MΩ) were filled with internal recording solution (in millimolar concentration): 120.0 CsMeSO3, 5.0 NaCl, 0.16 CaCl2, 10.0
TEA-Cl, 10.0 Hepes, 5.0 QX-314, 4.0 Mg-ATP, 0.3 Na-GTP. Recordings were
performed on a submersion-style recording chamber with a fixed-stage Olympus BX51 upright microscope with continual perfusion of 95% O2/5% CO2
bubbled artificial cerebrospinal fluid (in millimolar concentration): 124 NaCl, 3
KCl, 2 CaCl2, 1 MgCl2, 26 NaHCO3, 1 NaH2PO4, and 16.66 glucose with (in micromolar concentration) 100.0 4-AP, 1.0 TTX, 10.0 gabazine, and 1.0 CGP 35348.
tdTomato expression was used to verify D1-MSNs. Whole-cell patch clamp recordings were made using a Multiclamp 700B amplifier using custom-written
freeware package WinFluor (John Dempster, University of Strathclyde, Glasgow, UK) as described (62, 71). Miniature excitatory postsynaptic currents
(mEPSCs) were recorded in voltage clamp held at −70 mV. Data were analyzed
using the MiniAnalysis program (Synaptosoft).
Fig. 6. Effect of acute cocaine challenge after withdrawal on AMPA glutamate receptor-mediated synaptic currents in D1-MSNs in the NAc core.
After 14 d of withdrawal (WD) from chronic exposure to cocaine (i.p., 15 mg/kg),
WT (A–C) and WAVE1 D1-KO mice (D–F) were acutely challenged with saline or
cocaine (5 mg/kg). Sample traces of mEPSC from WT (A) or D1-KO (D) D1-MSNs in
the NAc core are shown with vertical and horizontal scale bars. mEPSC frequency
(B) was reduced by an acute cocaine challenge without altering mEPSC
amplitude (C) in WT mice (Sal challenge: n = 9 cells, 6 mice; Coc challenge:
n = 6 cells, 3 mice). mEPSC frequency (E) and amplitude (F) were unchanged
by an acute cocaine challenge after withdrawal in D1-KO mice (Sal challenge: n = 10 cells, 7 mice; Coc challenge: n = 8 cells, 6 mice). Data were
analyzed by Mann–Whitney nonparametric analysis (*P < 0.05) and presented as box-and-whisker plots indicating the median, quartiles, and range.
