Functional imaging data collected during cognitive tasks show
which brain regions are active during those tasks, but do not
necessarily indicate which regions are essential for those tasks.
Here, in a study of two cases of selectively impaired written
naming of verbs after focal brain ischemia, we combined imaging and behavioral testing to unambiguously identify brain
regions that are crucial for a specific cognitive process. We used
magnetic resonance perfusion imaging to show that the selective impairment in each case was due to hypoperfusion (low
blood flow) in left posterior inferior frontal gyrus (PIFG) and
precentral gyrus (PrG); the impairment was immediately
reversed when blood flow was restored to these regions, indicating that parts of the left frontal lobe are crucial for representing and processing verbs.
Stroke1–7 or focal dementia8–11 can disproportionately affect
the ability to produce either nouns or verbs, indicating that
separate neural regions are crucial for producing each word
class. The location of these functionally distinct brain regions,
however, is unclear. Furthermore, most studies did not test if
the impairment was in accessing the meanings, phonological
forms or orthographic forms of the affected word class. Cases
of impaired written naming of verbs, with relatively spared oral
naming of verbs and spared written and oral naming of nouns,
can only be due to impaired access to orthographic forms of
verbs3. Here we report two such cases and identify regions of
neural dysfunction responsible for this modality- and word
class–specific deficit, using a new technique for identifying
brain–behavior relationships.
Case 1 is a 68 year-old woman who was tested 6 hours after
onset of writing difficulties. Case 2 is a 48 year-old woman who
was tested 12 hours after onset of writing impairment. Both
are right-handed and have normal attention, speech production, comprehension, oral reading, repetition and copying.
Both were impaired in spelling verbs and pseudowords (such as
glamp), and their written narratives contained accurate nouns,
but no accurate verbs. To substantiate the clinical impression of
disproportionately impaired written naming of verbs relative
to nouns, we administered a test of oral and written naming
and comprehension consisting of 30 pictures each of pure
verbs, pure nouns matched in surface frequency to the verbs,
and pure nouns matched in cumulative frequency to the verbs5.
Informed consent was obtained for the study, using forms and
methods approved by the institutional review board of the
Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine.
Case 1 correctly wrote the names of only 10/30 (33%) of
verbs, but 50/60 (83%) of nouns (P = 0.0001, Fisher’s exact
test). In contrast, she correctly named aloud 28/30 (93%) of
verbs and 58/60 (97%) of nouns (not significant, n.s.). Her
errors in writing consisted primarily of semantically related
words (swing?jump; add?numbers) and a few phonologically plausible misspellings (write?wright). Age-matched control subjects named the nouns and verbs with >97% accuracy
(mean, 98.8% for each).
Case 2 correctly wrote 16/30 (53%) of verbs and 56/60
(93%) of nouns in written picture naming (P < 0.001). However, oral naming of verbs was relatively spared: 21/30 (70%)
for verbs and 48/60 (80%) for nouns (n.s.). Errors in writing
were almost exclusively ‘don’t know’ responses. Both patients
were 100% correct in comprehension (word/picture verification) with verbs and 98–100% correct with nouns.
Impaired written naming of verbs in these cases cannot be
due to impaired access to semantic representations (meanings)
of verbs because in each case, oral naming of verbs (which also
requires access to semantic representations) was relatively
spared, and word/picture verification using the same stimuli
was 100% accurate. Impaired written naming of verbs also cannot be due to a general peripheral writing problem, as written
naming of nouns was relatively accurate. Our results indicate
impairment in accessing orthographic representations of verbs
for output in each case.
In an attempt to localize the neural regions responsible for
this deficit, we used magnetic resonance diffusion-weighted
imaging (DWI) to identify the acute infarct or dense ischemia,
and perfusion-weighted imaging (PWI) to identify areas of low
perfusion (poor blood flow) that corresponded to impaired
tissue function12,13. DWI and PWI multi-slice, single-shot,
echo planar imaging (EPI) sequences were obtained on a
General Electric Signa 1.5-tesla scanner within one hour of
language testing. DWI trace images were obtained with
bmax = 1,000 s/mm2 (TR/TE = 10,000/120 ms). PWI scans
(TR/TE = 2,000/60 ms) were obtained with 20 ml of contrast
material bolus power injected at 5 ml/s.
In both cases, scans showed a small, acute left subcortical
infarct on DWI, and a larger area of hypoperfusion (low blood
flow) in frontal cortical regions—including left PIFG and
PrG—on PWI (Figs. 1a and 2a). Middle, inferior and superior
temporal gyri were not affected.
Both subjects received intervention to improve blood flow
to the hypoperfused regions (Case 1, stenting of the left carotid;
Case 2, pharmacologically induced blood pressure elevation14).
In both cases, intervention resulted in both reperfusion of the
left PIFG and PrG and immediate reversal of the impairment,
indicating that the hypoperfused regions were responsible for
brief communications

the deficit (Figs. 1b and 2b). Within 12 hours after intervention that restored blood flow, written naming of verbs
improved to >90% correct in each case.
The disproportionate impairment of verbs in Cases 1 and 2
cannot be explained by greater ‘difficulty’ of verbs in the battery used, as other patients have shown more errors naming the
nouns than the verbs in this battery, at least in oral naming2,3,5,11. Furthermore, a third patient with acute stroke who
was administered this battery showed greater impairment in
written (and oral) naming of nouns than verbs. This 66 yearold, right-handed man, who was tested within 12 hours of
stroke symptoms, correctly wrote the names of 90% (27/30) of
the verbs and 47% (28/60) of the nouns (P < 0.0001). Word/
picture verification was completely accurate for both word classes. DWI showed small infarcts in posterior inferior and middle
temporal gyri and insula, and PWI showed hypoperfusion of a
large portion of posterior middle and inferior temporal gyri
(Fig. 3). Left PIFG and PrG, which were hypoperfused in Cases
1 and 2, were normally perfused in this patient.
Although a few previous studies have documented selective impairment in accessing the names of verbs in only one
modality of output, the neural basis for this has remained elusive. Previously described patients had very large strokes from
which they had recovered language skills except naming verbs3,
or had degenerative disease (in which it was impossible to
determine the precise areas of neural dysfunction)11. In the
present cases, the modality-specific impairment in written
verb naming was documented in the acute stage of stroke,
before the opportunity for extensive reorganization, or before
any therapy that might have focused on a single class of words
or modality of output. The crucial role of left PIFG and PrG in
written verb naming was demonstrated by showing that written naming of verbs was impaired when left PIFG and PrG
were hypoperfused, and recovered when this region was reperfused. Furthermore, written naming of verbs was disproportionately spared in Case 3, who had normal perfusion of these
frontal regions.
In summary, these cases shed new light on the organization of language in the brain by showing that the left PIFG
and PrG are crucially involved in representing and processing
orthographic word forms of verbs. We were able to identify
areas of dysfunctional brain tissue associated with selective
impairment in accessing verbs for written production and to
demonstrate that restoration of tissue function in these areas,
by restoring blood flow, successfully restored the ability to
access those word forms. This study shows a clearly localized
neural correlate of a highly specific deficit at the onset of the
deficit (before the opportunity for reorganization of
structure/function relationships or rehabilitation) in subjects
with previously normal neurologic function. These results
illustrate the remarkable organization of cognitive functions in
the cortex, as well as the use of a powerful new tool for documenting brain–cognition relations.
