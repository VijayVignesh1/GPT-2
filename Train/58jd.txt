The learning of new skills is characterized by an initial phase of rapid improvement in performance and a phase of more gradual
improvements as skills are automatized and performance asymptotes. Using in vivo striatal recordings, we observed regionspecific changes in neural activity during the different phases of skill learning, with the associative or dorsomedial striatum
being preferentially engaged early in training and the sensorimotor or dorsolateral striatum being engaged later in training.
Ex vivo recordings from medium spiny striatal neurons in brain slices of trained mice revealed that the changes observed in vivo
corresponded to regional- and training-specific changes in excitatory synaptic transmission in the striatum. Furthermore, the
potentiation of glutamatergic transmission observed in dorsolateral striatum after extensive training was preferentially expressed
in striatopallidal neurons, rather than striatonigral neurons. These findings demonstrate that region- and pathway-specific
plasticity sculpts the circuits involved in the performance of the skill as it becomes automatized.
Learning to execute and automatize certain actions is essential for
survival. The learning of new skills by trial and error, such as riding a
bicycle or playing a piano, is characterized by an initial stage of rapid
improvement in performance, followed by a phase of more gradual
improvements as the skills are consolidated and performance asymptotes1–4. These two different phases of skill learning have distinct
behavioral and physiological hallmarks1,5–7. For example, the early
fast phase is susceptible to interference, whereas the later, more
automatic, phase is more resistant to interference5. After consolidation,
the memory of how to do things is long-lasting and it can last a lifetime
for well-learned skills.
Previous studies have shown that changes occur in neural activity in
the striatum, the major input nucleus of the basal ganglia, during
motor and procedural learning8–13. Some studies also suggested that
the striatal circuits and processes engaged during the early and late
phases of skill learning may differ2,3,14. For example, the dorsomedial or
associative striatum (DMS, roughly homologous to the caudate in
primates), which receives input primarily from association cortices
such as the prefrontal cortex15,16, seems to be preferentially involved in
the initial stages of visuomotor learning and during the rapid acquisition of action-outcome contingencies2,3,17. On the other hand, the
dorsolateral or sensorimotor striatum (DLS, roughly homologous to
the putamen in primates), which receives inputs from sensorimotor
cortex15,16, is critical for the more gradual acquisition of habitual and
automatic behavior2,3,18.
We recorded neural activity in the associative and sensorimotor
striatal regions during the different stages of skill learning in vivo and
found that the task-related activity in these striatal regions differed
during the acquisition and consolidation of a new skill, with the DMS
being engaged during the early phase and the DLS being engaged
during the late phase. We confirmed the differential involvement of
these striatal regions in the different stages of skill learning using
selective excitotoxic lesions of the dorsal striatum. We next investigated
whether the changes in striatal neural activity observed during skill
learning could be mediated by synaptic plasticity or excitability changes
in medium spiny projection neurons in the dorsal striatum using an
ex vivo approach and found that learning was accompanied by longlasting changes in glutamatergic transmission. These changes evolved
dynamically during the different phases of skill learning; changes in the
DMS were predominant early in training, whereas changes in the DLS
emerged only after extensive training. Finally, we found that these longlasting changes in the DLS after extensive training were pathway
specific and occurred predominantly in dopamine receptor 2 (D2)-
expressing striatopalidal medium spiny neurons. Consistent with this
observation, the performance of the skill after extended training
became less dependent on the activation of D1-type dopamine receptors, which are mainly expressed in striatonigral neurons.
RESULTS
DMS and DLS involvement in early and late skill learning
To investigate whether the different regions of the dorsal striatum were
differentially engaged during the early and late phases of skill learning,
we simultaneously recorded the activity of medium spiny neurons in
the dorsolateral and dorsomedial striatal regions in vivo during the

different phases of skill learning (Fig. 1a,b). Motor-skill learning on the
accelerating rotarod has been shown to have distinct early and late
phases14,19. We bilaterally implanted six C57/Bl6J mice with microelectrode arrays that were designed to target these two striatal regions
simultaneously (Supplementary Fig. 1 online) and trained the mice
with ten trials a day for 8 d on an accelerating rotarod (see Methods;
Fig. 1c). We then examined the changes in neuronal activity during the
first two trials of training (naive), the last two trials of the first day
(early) and the last two trials on day 8 (late). We quantified the
modulation of the activity of putative medium spiny neurons during
running versus the intertrial period, when the animal rested at the
bottom of the apparatus in a relatively immobile state, using a rate
modulation index of runrest
run+rest 100 (Fig. 1b,d). In the DMS, the rate
modulation increased during the early phase of training (F5, 458 ¼ 3.7,
post hoc P o 0.05), but returned to naive levels with further training
(no difference between naive and late phase, post hoc P 4 0.05). In the
DLS, however, the modulation of firing rate increased gradually with
training (post hoc P o 0.05). There was no difference between the naive
group and the early group (P 4 0.05), but the rate modulation was
significantly increased late in training compared with both naive and
early groups (P o 0.05; Fig. 1d). The increased firing rate modulation
in DLS during the late phase of skill learning was accompanied by a
decrease in baseline firing rate during the intertrial period (naive ¼ 2.9
± 0.4 Hz, early ¼ 3.2 ± 0.5 Hz, late ¼ 1.9 ± 0.3 Hz; planned
comparisons: naive versus late, P ¼ 0.07; early versus late, P o 0.05),
suggesting that the signal-to-noise ratio increased in DLS after
extended training.
Overall, the number of task-related neurons (in which firing rate was
significantly modulated during running compared to the intertrial
period, P o 0.01, see Methods) remained relatively constant throughout training in DMS (naive ¼ 70%, early ¼ 78%, late ¼ 78%), but
increased slightly with training in DLS (naive ¼ 74%, early ¼ 80%, late
¼ 89%). We also measured the proportion of neurons in each striatal
region that were either positively (increased firing rate during running)
or negatively (decreased firing rate during running) modulated during
running (P o 0.01). In the DMS, there was a transient increase in the
percentage of positively modulated neurons early in training (w2
1,87 ¼
7.9, P o 0.05), but the percentage returned to the level of the naive
condition with extended training (Fig. 1e). Conversely, more neurons
became positively modulated in the DLS after extended training,
whereas fewer neurons became negatively modulated (w2
1,160 ¼ 7.17,
P o 0.05; Fig. 1e).
We next assessed the effect of selective excitotoxic striatal lesions on
the different phases of motor skill learning. Lesions of the dorsomedial
or the dorsolateral striata did not alter initial performance on the
rotarod, as indicated by similar levels of performance in lesioned and
sham mice during the first two trials (naive DMS: F1,19 ¼ 1.3, P 4 0.05;
DLS: F1,48 ¼ 1.3, P 4 0.05; Fig. 1f and Supplementary Fig. 2 online).
However, lesions of the DMS reduced performance on the rotarod
specifically during the early phase of training, whereas these lesions no
longer impaired performance after extended training (early: F1,19 ¼ 4.6,
P o 0.05; late: F1,19 ¼ 1.5, P 4 0.05), suggesting that the DMS is only
required during the early phase. On the other hand, excitotoxic lesions
of the DLS affected skill learning during the early phase and continued
to impair performance substantially during the late phase (early:
F1,48 ¼ 9.3, P o 0.05; late: F1,48 ¼ 10.5, P o 0.05), indicating that
the performance of the skill in the late phase requires the DLS, but not
the DMS.
Region-specific plasticity during early and late learning
We next investigated whether the region-specific changes observed
in vivo were driven by glutamatergic synaptic plasticity or excitability

changes in the striatum by training C57/Bl6J mice for either 1 d (early
phase) or 8 d (late phase) on an accelerating rotarod (Fig. 2a) and
investigating ex vivo the changes in DMS and DLS related to the
different phases of skill learning (Fig. 2b). We observed that performance improved rapidly during the first day of training (early group:
F9,339 ¼ 7.75, P o 0.05, post hoc first versus last trial, P o 0.05)
and asymptoted after 3 d of training (late group: F70,247 ¼ 70, P o 0.05,
post hoc; for the first trial of each day, latency increased significantly
until day 3, and for the last trial of each day, latency increased until day
2). Coronal slices containing the striatum were taken from trained and
naive mice at least 72 h after the last training session.
We first examined the effect of training on the magnitude of the
evoked striatal field potentials using an input-output analysis. We
found that the population spike amplitude in the DMS was larger in
naive animals and decreased after extended training (F2,38 ¼ 3.22, P o
0.05, post hoc naive versus late, P o 0.05; Fig. 2c). In contrast, the
average population spike amplitude in the DLS was smaller in naive
animals, but increased with training (F2,25 ¼ 9.01, P o 0.05, post hoc
naive and early versus late, P o 0.05; Fig. 2c). Consistent with these
findings the amplitude of the half maximal
evoked response was higher in the DMS than
in the DLS in naive animals (F1,27 ¼ 10.7, P o
0.05; Fig. 2d), whereas the half maximal
response amplitude was higher in the DLS
after extended training (F1,27 ¼ 7.01, P o
0.05). During the early training phase, the
evoked responses were equally large in these
two striatal regions (F1,12 ¼ 0.31, P o 0.05;
Fig. 2c,d). Such results indicate that there are
region-specific changes in responsiveness to
afferent input stimulation as a skill is acquired
and consolidated, which are consistent with
the changes in neural activity that are observed
in vivo.
These training-dependent changes in
evoked population spike amplitude could be
the result of changes in synaptic strength or
changes in excitability. To investigate whether
the changes in the input-output function in
these regions of dorsal striatum corresponded
to changes in synaptic strength, we performed ‘saturation’ experiments using a wellestablished protocol for striatal long-term
depression (LTD)20,21. If there was substantial
synaptic potentiation in the DLS after extended training, then the
synapses in this region would be further away from the ‘floor’ of the
modification range22 and thus would be capable of undergoing further
depression. We therefore predicted that it would be more difficult to
saturate LTD in the DMS early in training, whereas it would take more
inducing attempts to saturate LTD in the DLS after extended training.
After 15 min of baseline recording, we applied tetanic stimulation four
times, 30 min apart (each induction attempt consisted of two trains of
100 pulses of 10-ms duration delivered at 100 Hz, delivered 10 s apart,
using a stimulation strength that produced half the maximal response).
In the DMS, the magnitude of the LTD induced after four tetani was
greater at the onset of training (naive and early phase), but decreased
with extended training, whereas the amount of induced LTD in the DLS
increased in animals that received extended training (Fig. 2e,f). In
naive animals, more tetani were needed to reach LTD saturation in the
DMS than in the DLS, indicating that DMS synapses were further away
from saturation than DLS synapses (naive F1,29 ¼ 4.18, P o 0.05;
Fig. 2e). Conversely, more tetani were needed to reach LTD saturation
in the DLS than in the DMS after extended training (F1,29 ¼ 4.54,

P o 0.05; Fig. 2e). This pattern of results suggests that extended
rotarod training results in synaptic potentiation in the DLS.
Training-induced synaptic plasticity in DMS and DLS
To further investigate the nature of these changes, we carried outex vivo
whole-cell patch-clamp recordings from striatal medium spiny neurons
in slices from trained and naive mice. We measured the excitatory
postsynaptic potential (EPSP) slope in response to increasing afferent
stimulation strengths in each striatal region (Fig. 3a). Consistent with
our observations in the field recordings, the average synaptic strength
was higher in the DMS earlier in training, but increased in the DLS after
extended training (F4, 221 ¼ 6.7, P o 0.05; post hoc tests comparing late
training group with all other groups, P o 0.05). During the early phase,
the difference between the EPSP slope elicited in the dorsomedial and
dorsolateral regions increased compared with naive animals, as evidenced by a larger EPSP slope being elicited even at our minimal
stimulation strength (post hoc 0.2 mA, P o 0.05; Fig. 3b), but this
difference disappeared during the late training phase.
These changes in EPSP slope were specifically related to learning the
skill and were not just induced by being exposed to the rotarod, as they
were not observed in yoked animals that had similar handling and were
placed on the rod for the same amount of time (Fig. 3b). In addition,
we did not observe any changes in paired pulse ratio (which could
indicate changes in the probability of presynaptic glutamate release;
Supplementary Fig. 3 online), input resistance and the resting membrane potential of the neurons (Supplementary Table 1 online).
Because the EPSP slope is proportional to the fast AMPA receptor–
mediated component of glutamatergic transmission, these results
suggest that extended training results in a long-lasting potentiation
of the AMPA component specifically in the
DLS. We further confirmed that the potentiation observed in the DLS was the result of an
increase in the AMPA receptor component by
recording spontaneous excitatory postsynaptic currents (sEPSCs) from medium spiny
neurons in the DLS after extended training.
We found that sEPSC amplitude (t13 ¼ 3.3,
P o 0.05), but not frequency (t13 ¼ 1.6,
P 4 0.05), was increased after extensive
training, an indication of a postsynaptic (but
not presynaptic) site of expression for the
plasticity (Supplementary Fig. 4 online).
We measured the relative amplitude of
synaptic currents mediated by the NMDA
and AMPA glutamatergic receptors in voltage-clamp recordings. To our surprise, we
found a significant increase in the NMDA/
AMPA ratio in the overtrained DLS, suggesting that the NMDA-mediated current
increased even more than the AMPA component in this region after extended training
(main effect of group: F4, 54 ¼ 5.36, P o
0.05; post hoc comparisons, late group higher
than all other groups, P o 0.05; Fig. 3c). No
such increase in NMDA/AMPA ratio was
observed in the DMS (F4, 39 ¼ 0.35, P 4 0.05).
We also measured intrinsic excitability by
injecting current into medium spiny neurons
and recording the number of action potentials
that were generated (Fig. 4). Although we
observed a small reduction in excitability in
the DMS after extended training, we found a significant increase in
excitability in the DLS, already evident during the early phase and
maintained during the late phase (naive and early versus late, planned
comparisons at 600 pA of injected current, P o 0.05; Fig. 4a). This is
consistent with the observation of increased population spike amplitude in DLS early in training (Fig. 2c) and with the effects of the DLS
lesions early in training (Fig. 1f). However, the increase in excitability
in the DLS cannot be attributed solely to the learning of the skill, as it
was also observed in yoked controls (late versus late yoked, planned
comparison, P 4 0.05; Fig. 4b), suggesting that these changes could
arise from other factors such as the stress associated with the task. In the
DMS, although the excitability was significantly reduced in the late
phase group compared with the early or the naive conditions (planned
comparisons at 600 pA of injected current, P o 0.05), there was no
significant difference between the late group and its yoked controls
(P 4 0.05), suggesting that this reduction in excitability may not be
directly associated with learning.
To examine the consequences of the changes in glutamatergic
transmission and excitability for the relation between afferent excitatory input and the spiking of medium spiny neurons (output), we
measured the effects of training on the threshold for spiking, as
measured by the intensity of afferent stimulation needed to evoke an
action potential in medium spiny neurons (Fig. 4c). We found that the
average afferent stimulation intensity necessary to evoke a spike was
lower in the DMS than in the DLS early in training (F1,28 ¼ 6.46, P o
0.05; Fig. 4c,e). With extended training, however, the threshold afferent
stimulation necessary to evoke spiking increased in the DMS and
decreased significantly in the DLS (interaction training  region:

DLS early versus late, P o 0.05; Fig. 4e). Because the EPSP magnitude
that is necessary to evoke a spike did not change with training,
this decrease in spike threshold in the DLS was probably caused by
increased synaptic strength and not by increased excitability (Fig. 4d,e).
These results are consistent with the firing rate modulation that was
observed in these two striatal areas during skill acquisition and
consolidation in vivo (Fig. 1) and suggest that these changes were
mediated by long-lasting plasticity of glutamatergic synapses onto
medium spiny neurons.
Circuit-specific plasticity after extended training
We observed potentiation of glutamatergic transmission in about 55%
of the neurons recorded in the DLS after extended training. Medium
spiny neurons projecting preferentially to the substantia nigra (striatonigral or ‘direct’ pathway) and medium spiny neurons projecting to
the external globus pallidus (striatopallidal or ‘indirect’ pathway) have
different dopamine receptor expression, different physiological properties and different plasticity mechanisms23–26. Until recently, long-term
potentiation (LTP) induction in the striatum
was thought to require D1-receptor activation27, suggesting that it would occur predominantly in striatonigral neurons, which
preferentially express D1 receptors, and not
in striatopalidal neurons, which mainly express D2 receptors. However, recent studies
have shown that LTP can occur in both types
of neurons, but by different mechanisms26. We
therefore examined whether the long-lasting
potentiation observed in DLS after extended
training occurred in both striatonigral and
striatopalidal neurons by recording from
medium spiny neurons in the DLS of D2–
enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP)
mice that were extensively trained on the
rotarod (Fig. 5a,b). These mice express
EGFP under the D2 promoter and therefore
allow the visualization of neurons that express
D2 receptors, which are almost exclusively
striatopallidal neurons (Fig. 5a)26. We
observed that rotarod training resulted in a
slight, but not significant, potentiation in the
non–D2-expressing neurons (putative striatonigral neurons, no interaction between training and stimulation strength, F1,20 ¼ 0.49,
P 4 0.05; no effect of training, F1,20 ¼ 2.35,
P 4 0.05; no significant post hoc at each
stimulation strength), but in a much greater
potentiation in the D2-expressing neurons
(striatopallidal, interaction between training
and stimulation strength, F1,26 ¼ 4.10, P o
0.05; effect of training, F1,26 ¼ 4.54, P o 0.05;
post hoc significant at 1-mA stimulation
strength) in the DLS of extensively trained
animals (Fig. 5c). No training-induced
differences were observed in paired pulse
ratio and excitability in D2-EGFP neurons
and non–D2-EGFP neurons (Supplementary
Fig. 5 online).
The difference in the magnitude of excitatory transmission potentiation between the
striatonigral and striatopallidal neurons suggests that the indirect pathway becomes more engaged relative to the
direct pathway as a skill is automatized. Whether its increased role is in
suppressing unnecessary and competing motor programs or in facilitating automatic motor programs remains unclear. In rats, D1 receptor
expression is slightly more prominent in ventrolateral and ventromedial
striatum than in dorsolateral striatum, whereas D2 receptor expression
is more abundant in dorsolateral striatum than in dorsomedial striatum28,29. By measuring D2 receptor binding in C57Bl6/J mice, we
verified that D2 receptor membrane expression was much higher in DLS
than DMS (F1,11 ¼ 122,5, P o 0.05; Fig. 5d), whereas membrane
expression of D1 receptors was more similar between DMS and DLS
(F1,10 ¼ 0.15, P 4 0.05; Fig. 5d). Therefore, we tested whether blocking
D1 or D2 dopamine receptors, which are preferentially expressed in
striatonigral and striatopallidal neurons, respectively, would differentially affect the performance of the skill early and late in training.
We verified that blockade of D1 and D2 receptors in naive animals
rendered the animals completely akinetic and incapable of staying on
the rod during the first two trials of learning (overall effect, F3,19 ¼ 20.3,

P o 0.05; post hoc saline versus D1 + D2, P o 0.05; Fig. 5e and
Supplementary Video 1 online). Blockade of either D1 or D2 receptors
alone also affected the performance of naive animals in the rotarod,
although to a lesser extent than blockade of both D1 and D2 receptors
(post hoc saline versus D1 or D2, P o 0.05; D1 + D2 versus D1 or D2,
P o 0.05; D1 versus D2, P 4 0.05). During the early stage of training,
the results were similar to those observed in naive animals (F3,57 ¼ 50.2,
P o 0.05; post hoc as in naive). However, after extensive training, D1
blockade no longer affected performance of the skill (F3,32.3 ¼ 32.3,
P o 0.05; post hoc saline versus D1, P 4 0.05), whereas D2 blockade
still affected the performance substantially (saline versus D2, P o 0.05).
This suggests that D1 receptor activation is no longer necessary for the
performance of the skill after extended training (Supplementary
Video 2 online). Consistently, the performance of mice with both D1
and D2 receptors blocked was similar to the performance of animals
with D2 blockade alone (D1 + D2 versus D2, P 4 0.05).
Taken together, these data suggest that, with extensive training, the
potentiation of excitatory transmission onto medium spiny neurons of
the DLS occurs predominantly in D2 receptor–expressing striatopallidal neurons at the same time that the performance of the skill becomes
less dependent on the activation of D1 receptors, which are mainly
expressed in striatonigral neurons.
DISCUSSION
The data presented here suggest that there is a
substantial functional reorganization of the
dorsal striatum during the acquisition and
automatization of a motor skill. Long-term
synaptic plasticity in the striatum has been
observed with a variety of protocols in brain
slices and in anesthetized animals20,21,30. To
the best of our knowledge, the data reported
here, both in vivo, in awake behaving mice,
and ex vivo, in striata taken from trained mice,
constitute the first evidence of region-specific
and pathway-specific long-lasting synaptic plasticity in the striatum
during the acquisition and consolidation of a skill. Taken together with
previous studies showing that mice that lack LTP specifically in the
striatum are impaired in skill learning31 and that LTP can be induced in
the striatum in vivo by intracranial self-stimulation30, our studies
indicate that long-lasting potentiation of glutamatergic transmission
in the striatum is necessary for skill learning.
A notable observation is the pronounced difference between the
direction of changes observed in dorsolateral (sensorimotor) striatum
and dorsomedial (associative) striatum during the different phases of
skill learning. This pattern is consistent with previous work in both rats
and monkeys suggesting distinct functional roles for these regions on
the basis of the origin of their main cortical afferents, that is,
sensorimotor versus association cortices2,3,17,18. In the associative
striatum (DMS), potentiation of synaptic strength is only observed
early in training, with extended training resulting in a return of
synaptic strength back to naive levels. In contrast, no substantial
potentiation of synaptic strength occurs during the early learning
phase in the sensorimotor striatum (DLS), but long-lasting potentiation of glutamatergic transmission develops with extended training.
How this long-lasting potentiation in DLS relates to skill automatization is still not clear, especially given that it was observed in a

substantial proportion of the neurons; one possibility is that it could
subserve the generation of central pattern generator–type ensembles in
sensorimotor cortico-thalamo-striatal circuits32. Furthermore, it
remains to be determined whether this long-lasting potentiation
observed in DLS is accompanied by structural plasticity (for example,
by an increase in the number of spines and synapses).
A straightforward explanation for these observations is that early on
in acquisition, during the fast phase of skill learning, the inputs from
associative cortices into dorsomedial striatum are preferentially
strengthened, whereas the inputs into sensorimotor striatum are
gradually potentiated with extended training, as shown by an increase
in synaptic strength, excitability, NMDA currents and firing rate
modulation during running on the rotarod. These results are consistent
with recent in vivo work showing that the coordination between
cortical areas and striatal regions has a mediolateral gradient33. These
findings provide a possible mechanism to explain previous results
showing that these different striatal regions are involved in controlling
goal-directed actions and automatic habitual responses, respectively,
and that, with extended training, the control over behavior by the goaldirected system is replaced by the habit system2,3,17,18,34–36. Our lesion
results suggest a model in which fast and slow skill learning develop in
parallel in DMS and DLS, respectively, and not serially. DMS lesions
seem to affect performance only early in training, but have no effect
later on. However, DLS lesions affect behavior early in training and
continue to affect it later on. This interpretation of our skill learning
results is consistent with previous studies in operant conditioning
showing that lesions of the DMS accelerate acquisition of an interval
schedule of reinforcement, whereas lesions of the DLS impair it18, and
that inactivation of the DLS in habitual animals renders the behavior
goal-directed again37.
Although these differences in medial and lateral plasticity in the
dorsal striatum in vivo can be explained in part by differences in
anatomical connectivity, the distribution of key receptors and differences in dopaminergic release and uptake may also be involved. For
example, the CB1 endocannabinoid receptor, which is critical for habit
formation, is more abundantly expressed in the dorsolateral striatum38.
The role of dopamine during the different phases of skill learning is also
complex, not only because its mechanisms of release and reuptake show
substantial regional variation39,40, but also because it has different
physiological effects on two populations of projection neurons in the
striatum: D1 receptor–expressing and D2 receptor–expressing neurons26. We found that D2-expressing striatopallidal medium spiny
neurons in the dorsolateral striatum showed a preferential increase in
synaptic strength in comparison with striatonigral neurons after
extensive training. This is, to the best of our knowledge, the first report
showing an increase in synaptic strength in striatopallidal neurons as a
result of learning and is consistent with recent results that reported LTP
in this class of neurons26,41. These studies showed that the activation of
A2A adenosine receptors, which are colocalized with D2 receptors, is
critical for LTP in the striatopallidal pathway, whereas the activation of
D1 receptors is critical for LTP in the striatonigral pathway26,41. In
addition, a notable finding from our study is the increased NMDA and
AMPA currents following extended training. A recent study has
shown the importance of A2A receptors in the LTP of the NMDA
component of glutamatergic transmission42; such a mechanism may
well be critical for the training-induced potentiation that we observed
in the DLS.
We observed that performance on the rotarod became independent
of D1 receptor activation with extensive training (expressed mainly in
striatonigral neurons) but still required D2 receptor activation. These
findings are consistent with previous studies using a Pavlovian
approach task in rats43. We found it interesting that D1 and D2
receptors seem to be differentially expressed in the medial and lateral
regions of the dorsal striatum, with D2 receptor being more prominent
laterally28,29 (Fig. 5). In addition, D1 receptors have lower affinity for
dopamine binding than D2 receptors, suggesting that D1 receptor
activation requires a phasic increase in dopamine release, whereas D2
receptor activation can be achieved with tonic dopamine release44. This
suggests that during early acquisition of a new skill, when dopaminergic neurons show a phasic increase in activity in response to
novel elements of the task45, D1 receptors could be activated. With
extensive training and the development of automaticity, however,
phasic increases in dopaminergic activity can become less frequent45
and, consequently, the dopamine that is released would mainly activate
D2 receptors. Also, given the recent data indicating that D2-expressing
striatopallidal neurons have more and stronger inhibitory projections
to D1-expressing striatonigral neurons than the converse46, potentiation of glutamatergic transmission onto striatopallidal neurons could
result in increased inhibition of striatonigral neurons and serve as a
substrate for the competition between these different pathways in
behavioral control.
Our findings may have implications for our understanding of the
symptoms of Parkinson’s disease. It is well-known that individuals
with Parkinson’s disease can perform automatized movements, but
have difficulty initiating voluntary movements47,48. The progressive
loss of dopamine in Parkinson’s disease may first affect D1 receptor
activation (lower affinity) and affect D2 receptor activation later on.
Thus, our observation that D2-expressing striatopallidal neurons
are potentiated after extensive training and that automatized movements can become independent of D1 receptor activation may
provide a mechanistic explanation for the relative preservation of
more automatic movements in Parkinson’s’ disease (see Supplementary Videos 1 and 2).
In summary, we report evidence for extensive functional reorganization in the striatum during the acquisition and consolidation of a skill
via region-specific and pathway-specific changes in synaptic strength.
We observed that the neuronal activity in the dorsomedial and
dorsolateral striata of awake behaving mice changed across the different
phases of learning. These changes were accompanied by dynamic
patterns of synaptic plasticity in the associative striatum (DMS) and
the sensorimotor striatum (DLS) during the different phases of
learning. Although synaptic strength in the DMS was greater early in
training, extensive training induced long-lasting potentiation at
excitatory synapses onto medium spiny neurons in the sensorimotor
striatum (DLS). This potentiation in the DLS after extended training
occurred predominantly in D2 receptor–expressing striatopalidal
neurons at the same time that the performance of the skill became
less dependent on the activation of D1 receptors, which are mainly
expressed in striatonigral neurons. Together, these data provide a first
glimpse into the dynamic reorganization in neural circuits as a skill is
learned and automatized. These findings could shed light on why
voluntary movements are more affected than automatized movements
in individuals with Parkinson’s disease.
METHODS
Animals. All procedures were approved by the National Institute on Alcohol
Abuse and Alcoholism Animal Care and Use Committee. Adult C57Bl6/J male
mice (2–5-months-old) were used for all of the behavior and recording
experiments, with the exception of the D2-EGFP mice, which were on a
FVB/N;Swiss Webster genetic background. The C57Bl6/J male mice were
purchased from Jackson Laboratory at the age of 6–8 weeks and were given
at least 2 weeks to acclimate to the new environment.

Rotarod training. A computer-interfaced rotarod accelerating from 4–40
rotations per min over 300 s was used (ENV-575M, Med Associates). Animals
were trained with ten trials per day for either 1 d or 8 d (trained every other
day). This training protocol was chosen on the basis of studies determining the
time course of sensitivity of this task to interference, protein synthesis blockers
(data not shown) and dopamine receptor antagonists (Fig. 5d). Each trial
ended when the mouse fell off the rotarod or after 300 s had elapsed and there
was a resting period of approximately 300 s between trials. Yoked animals were
handled and placed in the rotarod in the same manner as the trained animals,
but without the rotation of the rod. During the in vivo recordings, the
beginning and end of the running period were signaled to the MAP recording
system (Plexon) as events. The D1 receptor antagonist SCH-23390 (0.4 mg per
kg of body weight, Sigma-Aldrich) and D2 receptor antagonist raclopride
(2.0 mg per kg, Sigma-Aldrich) were dissolved in phosphate-buffered saline
with 1% DMSO by volume (control injection) and injected intra-peritoneally
at 10 ml kg1 (these doses completely block the effects of 3,4-dihydroxyL-phenylalanine after dopamine depletion49, indicating complete block of D1
and D2 receptors in vivo).
Lesions. Excitotoxic lesions of the striatum were performed by injecting NMDA
into the striatum using a syringe pump (Razel Scientific) under general
anesthesia with isofluorane. Two cannulae were inserted per striatum (two
sites per dorsolateral or dorsomedial region on each hemisphere, one more
anterior and one more posterior, along a line connecting +1.18 mm anteriorposterior, +2.0 mm medial-lateral with +0.22 mm anterior-posterior, +2.6 mm
medial-lateral). We injected 0.25–0.4 ml of a 10 mg ml1 solution of NMDA
per site (2.25 mm from the surface of the brain) at a rate of 5–10 ml h1.
Animals were allowed to recover for at least 2 weeks before training
started. Lesions were verified post-mortem after perfusion and overnight
post-fixation with 4% paraformaldehyde (by weight) using Nissl staining
of 50-mm brain slices.
In vivo extracellular recording. Implanting of multi-electrode arrays and
in vivo recordings of neural activity in awake behaving mice were carried out
as described previously14. The multi-electrode arrays consisted of two rows of
eight polyamide-coated tungsten microwires (35 mm, CD Neural). The two
rows were separated by 1 mm, so that one row targeted the DLS and the other
targeted the DMS; electrodes in a row were separated by B200 mm. The
placement of the center of the array was 0.5 mm anterior to Bregma, 1.6 mm
lateral to Bregma and 2.2–2.4 mm below the brain surface. The placement of
the electrodes was verified post-mortem after perfusion and overnight postfixation with 4% paraformaldehyde, using Nissl staining of 50-mm brain slices.
After at least 2 weeks of recovery after surgery, single-unit and multi-unit
activity were recorded using the Plexon data acquisition system (Plexon).
Neural activity was initially sorted using an online sorting algorithm and then
re-sorted using an offline sorting algorithm on the basis of waveform,
amplitude and the interspike interval histogram. Because separate analysis of
single-unit activity did not yield different data from that of multi-unit activity,
the two datasets were combined.
Ex vivo slice recordings. The mice were killed by decapitation under halothane
anesthesia and their brains were rapidly transferred to ice-cold modified
artificial cerebrospinal fluid (aCSF) containing 194 mM sucrose, 30 mM NaCl,
4.5 mM KCl, 1 mM MgCl2, 26 mM NaHCO3, 1.2 mM NaH2PO4 and 10 mM
D-glucose. Modified aCSF was brought to pH 7.4 by aeration with 95% O2/
5% CO2. Coronal sections (250 mm thick) were cut in ice-cold modified aCSF
using a vibrotome 1000 and transferred immediately to normal aCSF containing 124 mM NaCl, 4.5 mM KCl, 2 mM CaCl2, 1 mM MgCl2, 26 mM NaHCO3,
1.2 mM NaH2PO4 and 10 mM D-glucose maintained at pH 7.4 by bubbling
with 95% O2/5% CO2 19–22 1C.
Extracellular field recordings were obtained with micropipettes (2.5–5 MO)
filled with 1 M NaCl solution. Slices were maintained at a temperature between
28 and 32 1C, stable within ± 1 1C during the experiment and stimulated via a
bipolar twisted-tungsten electrode placed in the striatum. For the LTD recordings, stimulus intensity was set to evoke a population spike amplitude that was
approximately half the size of the maximal evoked response. The highfrequency stimulation protocol used to induce LTD in field potential recordings
consisted of two 1-s duration trains of 100 pulses (each pulse lasted 10 ms)
delivered at 100 Hz, with 10 s between trains.
Whole-cell recordings were carried out as previously described50. Pipettes
were pulled from borosilicate glass capillaries on a Flaming-Brown
micropipette puller (Novato). The internal solution for voltage-clamp
experiments contained 120 mM cesium methane sulfonate, 5 mM NaCl,
10 mM tetraethylammonium chloride, 10 mM HEPES, 4 mM lidocaine
N-ethyl bromide, 1.1 mM EGTA, 4 mM magnesium ATP and 0.3 mM
sodium GTP, pH adjusted to 7.2 with CsOH and osmolarity set to
298 mOsm with sucrose. The internal solution for current-clamp experiments contained 150 mM potassium gluconate, 2 mM MgCl2, 1.1 mM
EGTA, 10 mM HEPES, 3 mM sodium ATP and 0.2 mM sodium GTP, with
pH adjusted to 7.2 with KOH and osmolarity set to B300 mosM with
sucrose. The external solution was aCSF with osmolarity adjusted to
B315 with sucrose.
Medium spiny neurons (soma diameter 5–10 mm) were identified visually
with the aid of differential interference contrast–enhanced visual guidance. For
the voltage-clamp experiments, the stimulus intensity was set to the level at
which the EPSC amplitude (AMPA component) was 200–400 pA. Synaptic
currents were recorded with an Axopatch 1D amplifier (Axon Instruments),
filtered at 5 kHz and digitized at 10 kHz. Slices were maintained at a
temperature between 28 and 32 1C, stable within ± 1 1C during the experiment.
Fluorescent medium spiny neurons in the D2-EGFP mice were visualized using
mercury arc lamp illumination and a Chroma cube U-41001 (Olympus BX51
microscope), and classified as putative striatopallidal neurons, whereas nonfluorescent medium spiny neurons were classified as putative striatonigral
neurons. Our identification was independently verified by differences in action
potentials evoked by injected current.
Statistics. Analyses of the rotarod behavior were carried out using one-way
ANOVA. Analyses of slice electrophysiology were performed using one-way or
two-way ANOVA, as appropriate. When appropriate, post hoc tests were applied
(Fisher’s protected least-significant difference, PLSD). The number of attempts
for each slice to reach saturation in Figure 1e was calculated using paired t tests
comparing the 10 min preceding the attempt and the 10 min before the next
attempt; the last attempt to produce a significant depression (P o 0.05) of the
population spike amplitude was considered to be the saturation point. For the
analyses of in vivo data (neural activity and lesion in Fig. 4) we considered the
first two trials of the first day, the last two trials of the first day and the last two
trials of the eighth day of training as naive, early and late phase, respectively14.
Significant positive or negative modulation of firing rate during running for
each neuron in Figure 4e was determined by using a 99% confidence
interval on the basis of the distribution of spikes during the intertrial period.
The data in Figure 4e were analyzed using the w2 statistic. Statistical
analyses were performed using Statview (SAS), SPSS (SPSS) and Neuroexplorer (Neuroexplorer).
Additional methods on immunofluorescence, dopamine receptor blockade,
and autoradiography are available in the Supplementary Methods online.
