Monogenic epilepsies with wide-ranging clinical severity have been
associated with mutations in voltage-gated sodium channel genes. In
the Scn2aQ54 mouse model of epilepsy, a focal epilepsy phenotype is
caused by transgenic expression of an engineered NaV1.2 mutation
displaying enhanced persistent sodium current. Seizure frequency
and other phenotypic features in Scn2aQ54 mice depend on genetic
background. We investigated the neurophysiological and molecular correlates of strain-dependent epilepsy severity in this model.
Scn2aQ54 mice on the C57BL/6J background (B6.Q54) exhibit a mild
disorder, whereas animals intercrossed with SJL/J mice (F1.Q54) have
a severe phenotype. Whole-cell recording revealed that hippocampal
pyramidal neurons from B6.Q54 and F1.Q54 animals exhibit spontaneous action potentials, but F1.Q54 neurons exhibited higher firing
frequency and greater evoked activity compared with B6.Q54 neurons. These findings correlated with larger persistent sodium current
and depolarized inactivation in neurons from F1.Q54 animals. Because calcium/calmodulin protein kinase II (CaMKII) is known to modify persistent current and channel inactivation in the heart, we
investigated CaMKII as a plausible modulator of neuronal sodium
channels. CaMKII activity in hippocampal protein lysates exhibited
a strain-dependence in Scn2aQ54 mice with higher activity in F1.Q54
animals. Heterologously expressed NaV1.2 channels exposed to activated CaMKII had enhanced persistent current and depolarized
channel inactivation resembling the properties of F1.Q54 neuronal
sodium channels. By contrast, inhibition of CaMKII attenuated persistent current, evoked a hyperpolarized channel inactivation, and
suppressed neuronal excitability. We conclude that CaMKII-mediated
modulation of neuronal sodium current impacts neuronal excitability
in Scn2aQ54 mice and may represent a therapeutic target for the
treatment of epilepsy.

Voltage-gated sodium channels are essential for the generation and propagation of action potentials in excitable cells
(1). These proteins exist as heteromultimeric complexes formed
by a large pore-forming α-subunit and one or more auxiliary
β-subunits (2). Function of voltage-gated sodium channels is influenced by multiple intracellular factors including protein–protein interactions, channel phosphorylation, and intracellular calcium. The
auxiliary β-subunits and a family of FGF homologous factors (FHF)
have been shown to modulate trafficking and functional properties
of voltage-gated sodium channels (3–5). Both PKA and PKC have
been shown to modulate neuronal voltage-gated sodium current
function (6, 7). Finally, intracellular calcium, calmodulin, and calcium/calmodulin protein kinase II (CaMKII) have been shown to
have drastic effects on the cardiac sodium channel (8–10). Thus,
differences in posttranslational modification of sodium channels may
profoundly influence the physiology of excitable cells.
Mutations in genes encoding neuronal voltage-gated sodium
channels (SCN1A, NaV1.1, and SCN2A, NaV1.2) have been associated with several types of human epilepsy, including genetic epilepsy with febrile seizures plus (GEFS+) and benign familial
neonatal infantile seizures (BFNIS), and the more severe Dravet
syndrome and early infantile epileptic encephalopathy type 11
(EIEE11) (2, 11). To date, more than 1,200 SCN1A mutations have
been identified, making this gene the most frequently identified
cause of monogenic epilepsy. Interestingly, variable expressivity is a
common feature of monogenic epilepsy disorders, suggesting that
genetic modifiers may contribute to clinical severity (12).
In Scn2aQ54 mice, transgenic expression of a gain-of-function
sodium channel mutation results in epilepsy (13). Hippocampal
pyramidal neurons isolated acutely from Scn2aQ54 mice exhibit
enhanced persistent sodium current and spontaneous action potential firing. Scn2aQ54 mice congenic on the C57BL/6J strain
(B6.Q54) show a progressive epilepsy beginning with spontaneous
partial motor seizures that evolve to include secondary generalization as the mice age. Scn2aQ54 mice also exhibit a reduced life
span compared with wild-type (WT) animals (13). Genetic background exerts a profound effect on phenotype severity in the
Scn2aQ54 model. A single forward cross onto the SJL/J strain
(F1.Q54) results in significant worsening of the epilepsy phenotype, with both increased seizure frequency and reduced life
span compared with B6.Q54 animals (14).
Previous work identified two modifier loci that contribute to the
strain difference in seizure frequency and severity in the Scn2aQ54
model (14). Moe1 (modifier of epilepsy 1) involves multiple genes
including Cacna1g, encoding the T-type Ca2+ channel CaV3.1, and
Hlf, a PAR bZip transcription factor, whereas Moe2 involves a
single gene, Kcnv2, which encodes the silent K+ channel subunit
KV8.2 (15-17). Additionally, RNA sequencing analysis of parent
mouse strains revealed several other genes with divergent expression between mouse strains that may contribute to strain-dependent
epilepsy severity, including genes directly involved in ion transport
and posttranslational regulation of ion channel or transporters (18).
Significance
Epilepsy is a neurological disorder affecting approximately 1% of
the world population. Mutations within genes encoding voltagegated channels are the most frequently identified cause of
monogenic epilepsies. Variable expressivity is a common feature
of many epilepsies, suggesting that modifier genes make significant contributions to clinical phenotype. Here, we report an investigation of the molecular basis for strain-dependent seizure
severity in the Scn2aQ54 epileptic mice. We show strain-dependent
differences in pyramidal cell excitability correlate with divergent
properties of voltage-gated sodium channels that could be
explained by differences in calcium/calmodulin protein kinase II
(CaMKII)-dependent modulation of neuronal sodium channels.
These findings suggest that strain-dependent sodium channel
modulation by CaMKII in Scn2aQ54 mice influences excitatory
neuronal networks.

However, the underlying physiological mechanisms of straindependent epilepsy remain unexplored.
Here, we tested the hypothesis that strain-dependent seizure
severity in Scn2aQ54 mice results from differential neuronal hyperexcitability stemming from divergent sodium channel properties between strains. We demonstrated that neurons from F1.Q54
animals exhibit enhanced excitability compared with B6.Q54 animals, have greater persistent sodium current, and have sodium
channels that are more resistant to inactivation. Additionally, we
discovered that CaMKII modulates neuronal voltage-gated sodium conductance and may be an important mediator of straindependent seizure severity. Thus, our findings indicate that the
epilepsy phenotype of the Scn2aQ54 model may be, in part, driven
by divergent strain-dependent sodium channel dysfunction and
that CaMKII modulation of neuronal voltage-gated sodium current impacts neuronal excitability.
Results
Scn2aQ54 mice exhibit spontaneous focal epilepsy associated with
enhanced persistent sodium current in acutely dissociated hippocampal neurons (13). Additionally, the phenotype shows a
strong strain dependence, with animals on a congenic C57BL/6J
background (B6.Q54) having a significantly less severe phenotype compared with animals intercrossed with WT SJL/J mice for
a single generation (F1.Q54) (14). However, the neurophysiological basis for strain-dependent phenotype severity is unknown.
Strain-Dependent Neuronal Excitability. We hypothesized that differences in epilepsy severity observed between B6.Q54 and
F1.Q54 animals correlate with differences in excitability of hippocampal pyramidal neurons. We used whole-cell current clamp
recording to measure spontaneous and evoked action potential
activity in pyramidal neurons isolated from transgenic animals of
either background strain. Neurons isolated from WT animals
exhibited minimal spontaneous action potential generation, as
expected (Fig. 1 A and B). By contrast, and consistent with a
spontaneous seizure phenotype, neurons from both strains of
Scn2aQ54 animals fired spontaneous action potentials. However,
neurons isolated from F1.Q54 animals exhibited a significantly
higher frequency of spontaneous action potential firing compared with B6.Q54 animals (Fig. 1C; F1.Q54: 6.5 ± 1.5 Hz vs. B6.
Q54: 2.5 ± 0.5 Hz, n = 8–9, P < 0.05).
In addition to spontaneous activity, we also measured evoked
action potential firing. Similar to spontaneous activity, neurons
isolated from F1.Q54 animals exhibited significantly greater
evoked activity compared with neurons from B6.Q54 mice across
a range of current injection amplitudes (Fig. 2). Neurons from
F1.Q54 mice were more excitable at low amplitude current injections and showed sustained activity at stronger stimuli compared with neurons from B6.Q54 animals (Fig. 2 A–C). No
differences between strains were detected in either input resistance (B6.Q54 = 1.9 ± 0.3 GΩ vs. F1.Q54 = 2.2 ± 0.4 GΩ) or
action potential threshold (B6.Q54 = −42.7 ± 0.8 mV vs. F1.Q54 =
−42.5 ± 0.8 mV). Additionally, neurons from F1.Q54 animals displayed a more narrow action potential width both at the beginning
and end of a train of action potentials evoked by a 50-pA stimulus
(Fig. 2D; first action potential: B6.Q54 = 3.1 ± 0.2 ms vs. F1.Q54 =
2.5 ± 0.1 ms, P < 0.05; final action potential: B6.Q54 = 5.1 ± 0.5 ms
vs. F1.Q54 = 3.5 ± 0.4 ms, P < 0.05, n = 8–9). Interestingly, action
potential duration increased significantly during a train of action
potentials for B6.Q54 animals (first AP: 3.1 ± 0.2 ms vs. last AP:
5.1 ± 0.5 ms, P < 0.05), whereas that of F1.Q54 animals did not (first
AP: 2.5 ± 0.1 ms vs. last AP: 3.5 ± 0.4 ms), suggesting an adaptive
mechanism present in B6.Q54 animals is absent in neurons
from F1.Q54 mice. These results indicate that the strain-dependent
epilepsy severity observed for the Scn2aQ54 mouse model is correlated with divergent excitability of hippocampal pyramidal cells.
Differences in action potential morphology between strains further
suggest variable contribution of conductances necessary for action
potential generation and propagation.

Strain-Dependent Biophysical Properties of Neuronal Sodium Conductance.
The Scn2aQ54 model was originally generated with a specific defect in
voltage-gated sodium channels that gives rise to enhanced persistent
sodium current. To determine strain-dependent differences in sodium current, we performed whole-cell voltage clamp recordings
from acutely dissociated hippocampal pyramidal neurons from
B6.Q54 and F1.Q54 mice, as well as WT animals (B6.WT and
F1.WT). Sodium currents from neurons isolated from B6.Q54 and
F1.Q54 animals exhibited similar current–voltage relationships and peak
current densities (Fig. 3 A and B, B6.Q54: −366.8 ± 55.2 pA/pF vs.
F1.Q54: −308.5 ± 31.3 pA/pF, n = 12–15). Further, there were no
differences in peak current densities between neurons isolated from
the corresponding nontransgenic WT animals (Fig. S1A, B6.WT:
−266.4 ± 37.9 pA/pF vs. F1.WT: −302.0 ± 32.5 pA/pF, n = 13–16).
Comparison of voltage dependence of activation, and recovery from
fast inactivation, between B6.Q54 and F1.Q54 animals showed no
significant differences (Fig. 3 C and D and Table 1). However,
neurons from F1.Q54 animals exhibited significantly depolarized
steady-state channel availability compared with neurons from B6.Q54
animals (Fig. 3C and Table 1). This difference indicated that sodium
channels present in F1.Q54 neurons are more resistant to inactivation
compared with those present in B6.Q54 animals, and this phenomenon may contribute to neuronal hyperexcitability. Consistent with
this hypothesis, neurons from F1.Q54 animals show a larger window
current than B6.Q54 neurons, implying a broader voltage range over
which F1.Q54 neurons remain active (Fig. S2). No differences in
sodium channel properties were detected between WT strains (Fig.
S1 and Table 1), which suggests that the observed difference in sodium channel inactivation is mediated by the transgene.
Strain Dependence of Persistent Sodium Current. We hypothesized
that strain dependence of neuronal excitability may be due, in
part, to differences in persistent sodium current between B6.Q54
and F1.Q54 animals. We found that B6.Q54 pyramidal neurons
had persistent current levels that were not significantly different
from WT mice (Table 1). However, pyramidal neurons isolated
from F1.Q54 animals exhibited greater levels of persistent current compared with neurons from B6.Q54 mice (Fig. 3 E and F,
1.1 ± 0.2% vs. 0.4 ± 0.1, n = 6–8, P < 0.05). These data suggest
that higher levels of persistent current in hippocampal pyramidal
neurons correlate with enhanced excitability.
To exclude unequal transgene expression between B6.Q54 and
F1.Q54 as an explanation for differences in persistent current, we
quantified hippocampal transcript levels of rat NaV1.2 by using
quantitative digital droplet RT-PCR (ddRT-PCR). Using two
separate assays that are specific for the transgene, we found no
difference in hippocampal transgene levels between B6.Q54 and
F1.Q54 animals (Fig. S3; Assay Rn00680558: B6.Q54, 0.19 ± 0.03
vs. F1.Q54, 0.22 ± 0.05; Assay Rn00561862: B6.Q54, 0.13 ± 0.02
vs. F1.Q54 0.15 ± 0.05), thereby excluding divergent expression of
the transgene. Therefore, we considered other factors that could
account for the differences in sodium channel behavior.
Strain-Dependent Hippocampal CaMKII Activity. Previous work has
shown that the cardiac sodium channel NaV1.5 can be modulated
by intracellular Ca2+ and by CaMKII-mediated phosphorylation,
which have profound effects on channel inactivation and persistent sodium current (8, 10, 19). Elevated intracellular Ca2+ has
been demonstrated to evoke a depolarized shift in the voltage
dependence of inactivation and suppression of persistent sodium
current for cardiac NaV1.5 channels (8, 20). Similarly, CaMKIImediated phosphorylation of NaV1.5 causes a shift in the voltage
dependence of inactivation, as well as increased persistent sodium current (10, 19, 21, 22). We examined the effects of Ca2+
and CaMKII on the Scn2aQ54 mutant to determine whether
these factors could explain the observed differences in channel
inactivation and persistent sodium current.
The voltage dependence of inactivation and magnitude of
persistent sodium current were determined in the absence and
presence of 1 μM free Ca2+ for heterologously expressed mutant
rat NaV1.2 channels (NaV1.2-Q54; SI Materials and Methods),
which is the Scn2aQ54 transgene. We observed no difference in the
level of persistent sodium current between these two conditions
(0 Ca2+
: 3.5 ± 0.4%; 1 μM Ca2+
: 3.1 ± 0.3%, n = 10–12, P = 0.48),
and only a slight, but nonsignificant, depolarized shift in the
voltage dependence of inactivation (0 Ca2+
: −65.1 ± 2.0 mV; 1 μM
Ca2+
: −61.7 ± 1.8 mV, n = 10, P = 0.21; Fig. S4 A–C). These
findings were consistent with previous reports showing no effect of
intracellular Ca2+ on inactivation of WT NaV1.2 channels (23).
We conclude from these data that the strain differences in neuronal sodium current properties do not depend strictly on intracellular Ca2+ concentration.

To determine whether divergent CaMKII-mediated phosphorylation underlies strain-dependent differences in voltagegated sodium current, we quantified basal and maximal CaMKII
activity from hippocampal protein lysates from B6.Q54 and F1.
Q54 animals, and WT littermates. Basal hippocampal CaMKII
activity measured in samples from F1.Q54 animals was significantly greater than in samples from B6.Q54 animals (2.3 ± 0.16
A.U. vs. 1.8 ± 0.07 A.U., P < 0.05, n = 5; Fig. 4A). Levels of
maximal CaMKII activity, which were measured after adding
exogenous Ca2+ and CaM to protein lysates, were not different
between Scn2aQ54 strains (B6.Q54, 2.8 ± 0.2 A.U.; F1.Q54, 2.6 ±
0.6 A.U., P = 0.79, n = 5; Fig. 4B). Further, basal CaMKII activity normalized to maximal activity was significantly greater in
samples from F1.Q54 mice compared with B6.Q54 animals
(88.4 ± 3.6% vs. 68.2 ± 4.8%, P < 0.05, n = 5; Fig. 4C). There
were no differences in basal or maximal CaMKII activity between WT littermates from the different genetic backgrounds
(B6.WT, basal, 1.8 ± 0.03 A.U., maximal, 2.6 ± 0.04 A.U., n = 3;
F1.WT, basal, 1.8 ± 0.05 A.U., maximal, 2.6 ± 0.07 A.U., n = 5).
These differences suggest that differential CaMKII activity between mouse strains may contribute to strain-dependent differences in seizure severity in Scn2aQ54 mice.
Regulation of Sodium Channel Inactivation by CaMKII. We assessed
whether CaMKII modulates persistent sodium current and voltage
dependence of channel inactivation exhibited by heterologously
expressed NaV1.2-Q54. When activated CaMKII monomer was
included in the intracellular pipette solution, persistent sodium
current mediated by NaV1.2-Q54, was 8.5 ± 2.5% (n = 6)
compared with 2.8 ± 0.4% for cells exposed to vehicle alone (n = 6,
P < 0.05; Fig. 5A). Additionally, we observed a large depolarized shift
in the voltage dependence of inactivation compared with cells exposed
to vehicle (Fig. 5A, −49.6 ± 1.2 mV vs. −61.9 ± 2.4 mV, n = 3–5,
P < 0.05). Importantly, we found that CaMKII exerts similar effects on
WT NaV1.2 to enhance persistent sodium current (CaMKII = 2.0 ±
0.4%; Vehicle = 0.5 ± 0.2%, n = 6, P < 0.05; Fig. 5B) and induce a
large depolarized shift in the voltage dependence of inactivation
(−43.7 ± 1.5 mV vs. −56.4 ± 1.1 mV, n = 4–5, P < 0.05; Fig. 5B).
We also compared persistent current and steady-state inactivation in pyramidal neurons isolated from F1.Q54 animals
pretreated with either KN-93, a CaMKII inhibitor, or KN-92, an
inactive analog. Fig. 5C illustrates that neurons treated with KN93 exhibited virtually no persistent current (0.1 ± 0.1% n = 6) and
a hyperpolarized V1/2 for steady-state inactivation (V1/2 = −73.9 ±
2.2 mV, n = 6) compared with neurons treated with KN-92 (0.96 ±
0.2% n = 7, V1/2 = −64.9 ± 2.3 mV, n = 7, P < 0.05, compared with
KN-93–treated cells). Finally, we compared spontaneous firing
frequency of neurons treated intracellularly with 1 μM KN-93 or
1 μM KN-92 and found that suppression of CaMKII activity with
KN-93 abolished spontaneous firing of F1.Q54 neurons (0.06 ±
0.04 Hz, n = 7). By contrast, neurons treated with KN-92 exhibited
a high spontaneous firing frequency (5.4 ± 1.1 Hz, n = 7, P < 0.05;
Fig. 6 A and B) similar to untreated cells. We also observed that
KN-93–treated neurons showed less evoked action potential firing
compared with neurons treated with KN-92 (Fig. 6C). These data
support our hypothesis that differential modulation of sodium
channels by CaMKII significantly impacts neuronal excitability.
Discussion
Mutations in voltage-gated sodium channel genes are associated with
a spectrum of genetic epilepsies that may exhibit variable expressivity,
which is attributable in part to the action of genetic modifiers. The
influence of genetic modifiers on variable expressivity can be studied
by using engineered mice bearing mutations in sodium channel genes.
In this study, we examined the strain-dependent seizure severity
observed in the gain-of-function Scn2aQ54 epileptic mouse
and identified neurophysiological features that may contribute to
variable phenotype expression.
The Scn2aQ54 mouse model exhibits spontaneous seizures
originating within the hippocampus, the severity of which depends
greatly on genetic background. These mice show increased persistent sodium current as a result of mutant Scn2a transgene expression, and this phenomenon is a plausible contributing factor to
epilepsy. Extracellular recording of hippocampal slices from
F1.Q54 animals showed that both the CA1 and CA3 regions show
spontaneous action potential firing not present in WT mice (24).
Additionally, brain slices from F1.Q54 animals have greater
spontaneous and after-discharge activity following tetanic stimulation (24). Consistent with this prior work, we demonstrated that
hippocampal pyramidal neurons isolated from WT animals show
no spontaneous action potentials, but pyramidal neurons isolated
acutely from either B6.Q54 or F1.Q54 animals exhibit spontaneous action potentials, with cells from F1.Q54 mice having a higher

firing frequency. Additionally, F1.Q54 animals exhibit significantly
greater evoked action potential firing.
Action potential morphology is an important contributor to
neuronal firing frequency, with high frequency firing being associated with narrow action potential width (25). We observed
that pyramidal neurons from F1.Q54 mice exhibited narrower
action potentials compared with neurons from B6.Q54 animals.
Moreover, neurons from B6.Q54 animals exhibited a trend toward a greater degree of action potential broadening during a
train of action potentials compared with neurons from F1.Q54
animals (Fig. 2), consistent with the hypothesis that excitatory
neurons from F1.Q54 animals can maintain higher firing rates
for longer periods of time and may promote a more severe
seizure phenotype. Although increased persistent current is
predicted to broaden action potentials in neurons from F1.Q54
mice, previously reported strain-dependent differences in K+
channel expression may also contribute in a manner opposing
the effect of enhanced sodium current (15). Specifically, B6.Q54
mice express a higher level of Kcnv2, a silent K+ channel subunit
that forms heterotetramers with KV2.1 and suppresses delayed
rectifier current. Reduced KV2.1-mediated current is predicted
to enhance excitability of neurons from B6.Q54 mice, similar to
what has been demonstrated for KV2.1 knockout mice, and
evoked action potential broadening during a train of action potentials (26), which is what we observed in this study (Fig. 2).
We observed no strain differences in sodium channel properties measured from WT neurons. By contrast, neurons isolated
from F1.Q54 animals exhibited higher levels of persistent current
and a depolarized steady-state inactivation compared with
B6.Q54 mice. A consequence of the shift in steady-state inactivation for F1.Q54 animals compared with B6.Q54 animals is
a larger window current, which has been shown to be a common
feature of cardiac arrhythmias resulting from mutations in
SCN5A (27, 28). The greater tendency for spontaneous action
potential firing observed in F1.Q54 neurons may be a result of
both increased persistent current and increased window current.
Importantly, the larger persistent sodium current could not be
explained by differences in transgene expression within brain
regions we used to isolate neurons for electrophysiological recording. These observations suggest the existence of other factors that may modulate sodium channels.
We sought to understand the basis for different persistent
current levels between B6.Q54 and F1.Q54 animals. Phosphorylation of sodium channels is a critical regulator of channel activity, with phosphorylation state changing dramatically as a
function of seizure activity in the brain (6, 7). In the heart,
CaMKII phosphorylation has been shown to enhance persistent
sodium current and induce a shift in steady-state channel availability (19). Although the sites for CaMKII phosphorylation of
NaV1.5 are not perfectly conserved across all sodium channels,
24 of 36 CaMKII phosphorylation sites identified by either mass
spectrometry analysis or functional analyses, including the critical sites S516 and S571, are conserved in rodent NaV1.2 (10, 21).
Our experiments demonstrated that hippocampal lysates from
Scn2aQ54 mouse strains have divergent levels of CaMKII activity.
Previous reports have shown that CaMKII autophosphorylation is initially reduced in various epilepsy models, including

pilocarpine and kainic acid-induced seizure models, but total
CaMKII protein may be increased in prolonged timepoints following seizure onset (29–31). Interestingly, WT littermates do
not show strain dependence of CaMKII activity, suggesting that
seizures may also influence CaMKII activity in the hippocampus
of Scn2aQ54 mice. Although our findings strongly support
CaMKII modulation of neuronal sodium current and excitability
of neurons from Scn2aQ54 mice, we cannot exclude epileptogenic
effects of CaMKII on other cellular targets that also have strain
dependence.
In summary, our work demonstrated CaMKII modulation of
neuronal sodium channels in heterologous cells and in acutely
isolated neurons from a mouse model of epilepsy. CaMKII evokes a
mechanism to regulate neuronal sodium current in a manner that
impacts neuronal excitability. Pharmacological strategies for
suppressing CaMKII activity in brain might conceivably exert
antiepileptic effects.
