Migraine is characterized by severe headaches that can be preceded by an aura likely caused by cortical spreading depression
(SD). The antiepileptic pregabalin (Lyrica) shows clinical promise for
migraine therapy, although its efficacy and mechanism of action are
unclear. As detected by diffusion-weighted MRI (DW-MRI) in wildtype (WT) mice, the acute systemic administration of pregabalin
increased the threshold for SD initiation in vivo. In familial hemiplegic migraine type 1 mutant mice expressing human mutations
(R192Q and S218L) in the CaV2.1 (P/Q-type) calcium channel subunit,
pregabalin slowed the speed of SD propagation in vivo. Acute systemic administration of pregabalin in vivo also selectively prevented
the migration of SD into subcortical striatal and hippocampal regions in
the R192Q strain that exhibits a milder phenotype and gain of CaV2.1
channel function. At the cellular level, pregabalin inhibited glutamatergic synaptic transmission differentially in WT, R192Q, and S218L mice.
The study describes a DW-MRI analysis method for tracking the progression of SD and provides support and a mechanism of action for
pregabalin as a possible effective therapy in the treatment of migraine.

Migraine is a common debilitating episodic brain disorder
that presents as severe headaches accompanied by other
symptoms including nausea and vomiting. In approximately onethird of patients the headache phase is preceded by an aura,
thought to be caused by cortical spreading depression (SD) (1).
SD is characterized by electrocorticographic silencing and a directly
coupled potential shift that is generated by spreading neuronal and
glial depolarization. In addition to the aura in migraine, SD is associated with various pathological conditions, such as epilepsy, ischemic stroke, and subarachnoid hemorrhage (2–4). The SD wave
front of brief neuronal excitation is followed by a long-lasting depolarization and travels rostrally at a speed of 2–6 mm/min, rendering invaded tissue inactive (5). SD induces cell swelling and the
release of various neuroactive factors, including glutamate, potassium, protons, and prostaglandins that together contribute to the
pathophysiological process (4). A clue to the importance of SD in
migraine comes from the observation that in experimental models
cortical SD triggers downstream headache mechanisms through the
activation of trigeminal nerves and brainstem nuclei (6).
Familial hemiplegic migraine (FHM) is a monogenic form of
migraine with aura accompanied by hemiparesis (1). FHM type 1
(FHM-1) is caused by missense mutations in the CACNA1A gene
that encodes the α1A subunit of voltage-gated CaV2.1 (P/Q-type)
calcium channels (7). FHM-1 mutations introduced into the
orthologous Cacna1a gene produce transgenic mice with phenotypes that closely mimic both the milder (R192Q) and more
severe (S218L) symptoms described in FHM-1 patients with
these mutations (8, 9). FHM-1 mutations have been shown to
produce an overall gain-of-function increase in calcium conductance at physiological membrane potentials (10, 11); given the wellestablished role of the channels in the calcium-mediated release of
vesicular neurotransmitters, this increase can explain the increased
synaptic activity observed in the mutant animals (12–16).
Although a number of preventative and abortive treatments
are available, not all migraines are effectively treated, and hospitalization can be necessary for prolonged migraine attacks (2, 17).
Gabapentinoids (gabapentin and pregabalin) are small-molecule
drugs used clinically in the treatment of neuropathic pain and
partial seizures. Gabapentin was initially designed as a GABA analog, and pregabalin was developed to modulate GABA metabolism with the aim of generating new treatments for epilepsy.
Instead, these drugs were shown to bind to the α2δ1/2 subunits of
high-voltage–activated calcium channels with little direct effect on
either GABA receptors or metabolism (18). Although, initial
studies suggested that gabapentin may be effective in the treatment
of migraine, it has since been shown to have only nominal potency
in migraineurs (19). Pregabalin (Lyrica) displays more linear kinetics and a longer half-life than gabapentin (20) and has shown
initially encouraging results as a potential treatment for migraine
Significance
Spreading depression is proposed to underlie migraine with aura,
a type of debilitating headache for which few pharmacological
treatments are available. The pain drug pregabalin has demonstrated initial promising results for the treatment of migraine in
the clinic. Utilizing animal models of congenital migraine and live
brain imaging, we describe the cortical and subcortical migration
of the spreading depression wave. Further, pregabalin is shown to
be effective at suppressing spreading depression initiation, wave
speed, and subcortical propagation, and also to affect nerve cell
signalling directly. Overall, the study supports the therapeutic
potential of pregabalin in both noncongenital migraineurs and
patients with mild congenital migraine.

NEUROSCIENCE SEE COMMENTARY
(21–23), although additional evidence of clinical efficacy is required.
Although pregabalin’s exact mechanism of action has not been
deciphered, it has been shown to inhibit calcium currents acutely
(24) and to suppress calcium channel trafficking chronically (25).
Furthermore, pregabalin displays greater efficacy for P/Q-type
(CaV2.1) channels than for L-type (CaV1.1-CaV1.4) and N-type
(CaV2.2) channels (26). Although there is some controversy about
the putative acute versus chronic molecular mechanisms, pregabalin
has been associated convincingly with a reduction in excitatory
neurotransmitter release, further implicating CaV2.1 calcium
channels (27).
Here we examined FHM-1 mouse models to determine the
effects of pregabalin on the threshold for SD initiation and the
propagation speed of the SD wave front in vivo using a newly
developed, customized DW-MRI methodology. Using this
method of DW-MRI analysis, we were able to track the spread of
SD through the brain with proficient spatiotemporal accuracy.
Furthermore, we correlated the findings on SD with in vitro
analysis of pregabalin efficacy in acute brain slices using intrinsic
optical signaling (IOS) and with spontaneous and evoked synaptic activity in the hippocampus.
Results
Pregabalin Increases the Threshold for SD in WT Mice in Vivo. To
examine the full potential of our DW-MRI methodology in the
intact brain and in response to pregabalin administration, anesthetized mice were scanned using DW-MRI to visualize the
spread of SD in vivo. DW-MRI images were acquired as eight
consecutive slices at 8-s intervals for 13 min. SD was initiated
using dual carbon fiber electrodes implanted in the occipital
cortex (Fig. 1A and Fig. S1). Vehicle-treated WT and R192Q
mice did not display a significant difference in SD threshold (WT
vs. R192Q: P = 0.21, ANOVA), but the threshold was significantly lower in vehicle-treated S218L mice (WT vs. S218L: P =
0.02; R192Q vs. S218L: P = 0.03 ANOVA) (Fig. 1B). Subsequently, scans were acquired in WT and FHM-1 mice following
the administration of pregabalin (160 mg/kg i.p. 45–60 min before
scanning). Pregabalin treatment significantly increased the SD
threshold in WT mice; although a trend toward an increased
threshold was observed in the R192Q and S218L groups, a significant difference was not achieved for the FHM-1 strains (WT
control vs. WT pregabalin: P = 0.03, t test; R192Q control vs.
R192Q pregabalin: P = 0.14, t test; S218L control vs. S218L pregabalin: P = 0.15 t test) (Fig. 1B).
The sequential DW-MRI slices and 8-s temporal resolution
allowed tracking of the SD wave trajectory across the cortex. SD
was first visible in slice 3 (bregma −5.00) corresponding to the
electrode position in the occipital cortex (Fig. S1), and from this
point the wave front traveled both around the circumference of
the cortex and rostrally until reaching slice 8, the last slice acquired in the frontal cortex (Movies S1–S3). Of note, the SD
wave front did not invade the cerebellum (slices 1 and 2) (Fig.
S1D) in either the WT (n = 5) or FHM-1 (n = 12) strains. SD
could not be initiated in cerebellum even when stimulation
electrodes were placed directly in the vermis of the cerebellar
cortex, suggesting that this region is refractory to SD (n = 1).
Pregabalin Slows SD Speed in R192Q and S218L FHM-1 Mutant Mice in
Vivo. SD speed was calculated from the cortex as the wave front
traveled from slice 5 to slice 8. Both R192Q and S218L mice
displayed a faster SD than WT mice, and the speed was faster in
S218L mice than in R192Q mice (WT vs. R192Q: P = 0.04; WT
vs. S218L: P = 0.001; R192Q vs. S218L: P = 0.02, ANOVA) (Fig.
1C and Movies S1–S3). Notably, pregabalin treatment slowed
SD speed significantly in both R192Q and S218L strains but had
no effect in WT mice (WT control vs. WT pregabalin: P = 0.23;
R192Q control vs. R192Q pregabalin: P = 0.003; S218L control vs.
S218L pregabalin: P < 0.0001, t test) (Fig. 1C and Movies S4–S6).
A previous report found that SD is constrained to the cortex in
WT mice but can invade the striatum in R192Q mice and can invade
the striatum, hippocampus, and, occasionally, thalamus in S218L
mice (28). Our data generally are in line with these findings, except
that we did not observe SD invasion of the thalamus in S218L animals (Figs. 2 and 3 and Movies S1–S3). Of note, in R192Q mice we
observed that SD invaded both the hippocampus and striatum, albeit
with a significant delay of up to 1 min after the SD wave front had
passed through the cortex. In contrast, in S218L mice the SD wave
front moved into cortical and subcortical structures almost simultaneously, consistent with the larger gain-of-function effect of this
mutation. Notably, although pregabalin did not prevent the invasion
of subcortical structures in S218L mice, it completely abolished
spread into both striatum and hippocampus in four of five R192Q
mice tested (Figs. 2 and 3 and Movies S2, S3, S5, and S6).
For further visualization and quantitative comparisons of DWMRI images during SD enhance, a custom Matlab script was
designed to detect the SD wave front automatically and to represent
it in each slice as a heatmap in which cold colors correspond to early
and hot colors to late SD appearance. Representative examples
shown in Fig. S2 emphasize the cortical confinement of SD in WT
mice and the subcortical invasion in FHM-1 mice. Furthermore,
they confirm the marked delay in the arrival of the SD wave front in
striatum and hippocampus of R192Q mice. Finally, this image
analysis tool confirmed that pregabalin administration slows SD
speed in both strains of FHM-1 mice and prevents subcortical invasion of SD in R192Q mice.
Pregabalin Slows the Speed of SD in S218L Mutant Brain Slices in
Vitro. To examine the effects of pregabalin on SD further, we
used IOS imaging on acute brain slices from FHM-1 and WT mice.
In this preparation SD is visualized as an increase in brightness
resulting from the increased transparency of the brain tissue caused
by cell swelling during the depolarization (29). Bath application of
40 mM KCl induced SD in brain tissue, occasionally from more
than one focal point (Fig. 4). The SD wave front traveled across the
cortex and invaded (and sometimes was initiated in) the caudate
putamen in brain slices from both FHM-1 and WT mice (Fig. 4A).
In agreement with previous findings (8, 9), the speed of the cortical
SD wave front was significantly faster in brain slices from R192Q
and S218L animals than in slices from WT mice (WT vs. R192Q:
P = 0.01, ANOVA; WT vs. S218L: P = 0.001, ANOVA) (Fig. 4 A
and B). Pregabalin pretreatment (1 h) had no significant effect on
SD speed in brain slices from WT mice, but it significantly slowed
SD speed in brain slices from both R192Q and S218L animals (WT
control vs. WT pregabalin: P = 0.26, t test; R192Q control vs.
R192Q pregabalin: P = 0.03, t test; S218L control vs. S218L pregabalin: P = 0.0005, t test) (Fig. 4B). No significant difference in the
degree of localized cell swelling correlated with ΔIOS (29) was
observed either among strains or as a result of pregabalin pretreatment (Fig. 4C).

Pregabalin Acutely Inhibits CaV2.1 Calcium Channel Complexes Containing
the α2δ1 Subunit. To confirm pregabalin’s effects on CaV2.1-mediated
calcium currents, electrophysiological recordings were performed in
human-derived neuroblastoma SH-SY5Y cells transiently expressing
the recombinant human CaV2.1 subunit coexpressed with β2 and
either α2δ1 or α2δ3 auxiliary subunits. The effect of pregabalin pretreatment was assessed at a concentration of 500 μM, previously
reported to inhibit synaptic activity in the mouse brainstem auditory
system (30). The peak calcium current amplitude elicited by repetitive square depolarizations from a holding potential of −110 mV
to 0 mV was reduced by 27% (n = 8) when 500 μM pregabalin was
applied to SH-SY5Y cells expressing CaV2.1 cotransfected with the
β2 and α2δ1 subunits (Fig. 5A). Conversely, currents obtained upon
coexpression with the β2 and α2δ3 subunits were unaffected by pregabalin (Fig. 5A). The selective inhibitory effect on CaV2.1 channels
coexpressed with the α2δ1 but not with the α2δ3 ancillary subunit was
observed across a range of voltage steps elicited by a current–voltage
relationship (Fig. 5B). These results are consistent with gabapentinoids’ higher binding affinity for the α2δ1 subunit than for the α2δ3
subunit (31).
Pregabalin Suppresses Spontaneous and Evoked Synaptic Activity.
We next examined whether the effects of pregabalin on intrinsic neuronal excitability and/or synaptic activity levels could
explain the differential alterations in the threshold and speed of
SD in WT and FHM-1 mice. Whole-cell patch-clamp recordings
in hippocampal acute slices were used because the DW-MRI
analyses revealed that SD invasion occurred in this region in
S218L and R192Q mice but not in WT mice. Potential differences
in global hippocampal synaptic activity were investigated by recording spontaneous excitatory postsynaptic currents (sEPSCs) (see
Fig. S4B) in the absence of any stimulation or current injection,
using whole-cell voltage-clamp recordings with picrotoxin in the
patch pipette to block GABAergic inhibitory PSCs (IPSCs). Pregabalin (500 μM) significantly reduced the amplitude and increased
the sEPSC interval (i.e., decreased the sEPSC frequency) in CA1
neurons in slices from both WT and R192Q mice (Fig. 5 C and D
and Figs. S3 and S4A). Rather unexpectedly, pregabalin was found
to increase amplitude and decrease the interevent interval in S218L
CA1 neurons. At a lower concentration (100 μM) pregabalin had
no effect on sEPSC amplitude or frequency in WT neurons, reduced the frequency of sEPSCs in both R192Q and S218L neurons,
and increased the amplitude of sEPSCs in S218L CA1 neurons (Fig.
5E and Fig. S4A).
To examine the effect of pregabalin on electrically evoked EPSPs
(eEPSPs) in hippocampal slices, a paired-pulse stimulation protocol
was applied to glutamatergic CA3 axons (Schaffer collaterals) while
simultaneously recording voltage responses using current-clamp recordings in CA1 soma (Fig. 5F). To ameliorate cell-to-cell variability,
eEPSP amplitude was normalized to the control eEPSP peak. Although pregabalin (500 μM) significantly reduced the amplitude of
eEPSPs in both WT and R192Q neurons, it had no significant effect
on S218L CA1 neurons. At a lower concertation (100 μM), pregabalin inhibited eEPSP amplitude only in R192Q CA1 neurons. No
significant effect of pregabalin was observed on paired-pulse facilitation (Fig. 5F).
Discussion
One aim of this study was to develop advanced neuroimaging
methodologies that permit the in vivo visualization of SD in a

3D, whole-brain perspective with a high temporal resolution.
This methodology has permitted further insight into the spatiotemporal dynamics of SD in both WT mice and those displaying
mild (R192Q) or severe (S218L) FHM-1 phenotypes (7). Further, we tested the hypothesis that pregabalin, an antiepileptic with
high-affinity binding to α2δ1-containing calcium channel complexes,
may exhibit functional effects in FHM-1 and WT mice. Our key
findings concerning SD and the actions of pregabalin are (i) SD
threshold and speed are differentially affected by R192Q and S218L
FHM-1 mutations; (ii) in both FHM-1 strains SD invades the
striatum and hippocampus, albeit with a notable delay in R192Q
animals; (iii) SD does not invade the cerebellum in any strain or
under any stimulation protocol; (iv) the SD threshold is increased by
pregabalin in WT but not in FHM-1 mice; (v) pregabalin slows SD
velocity in both FHM-1 strains but not WT mice; and (vi) SD invasion of subcortical structures is suppressed by pregabalin in animals
expressing the milder R192Q change but not in animals expressing
the more severe S218L FHM-1 mutation.
SD Threshold and Speed Are Differentially Affected by the R192Q and
S218L FHM-1 Mutations. We observed a lower SD threshold in vivo
in S218L mice than in WT and R192Q animals, suggesting that
only the S218L CaV2.1 channel gain-of-function mutation was
sufficiently pathophysiological to promote the initiation of SD as
a result of cortical electrical depolarization. This finding was
somewhat unexpected because previous data indicated a lowered
SD threshold associated with both FHM-1 mutations (8, 9) and
also because both R192Q and S218L mice display enhanced
glutamatergic activity in cortical neurons (15, 16, 32). Notably,
the use of isoflurane (instead of urethane) in the current study
may have differentially affected the SD threshold. Also, the
carbon fiber electrodes used for stimulation in the MRI scanner
are larger in diameter than the metal electrodes used previously,
and this difference may have affected stimulation sensitivity (9).
If the stimulation threshold is modulated solely by the level of
synaptic excitability, a lower SD threshold would be expected in
both S218L and R192Q mice. Our findings may indicate that the
SD threshold is not linked directly to synaptic activity but instead
is linked to enhanced basal neuronal excitability in the cortex.
This notion fits with previous data demonstrating that cortical neurons from S218L mice display calcium currents with a distinct leftward shift in activation properties that is less pronounced in R192Q
mice (16). As a result, S218L neurons are predicted to have the
ability to conduct calcium at rest, endowing them with the ability to
modulate neuronal excitability at a range of membrane potentials
normally considered subthreshold (13).
Although the SD threshold was found to be decreased only in
S218L animals, we observed an increase in cortical SD conduction velocity, similar to that described previously (8, 9), in both
R192Q and S218L FHM-1 strains. The gain-of-function alterations
of CaV2.1 channels containing R192Q or S218L mutations likely

underlie the observed increases in SD speed in these strains; this
possibility is supported by studies demonstrating enhanced synaptic
activity in cortical neurons from both R192Q (15, 32) and S218L
mice (16).
SD Spreads to Subcortical Structures in Both FHM-1 Strains but Not in
WT Mice. Several mechanisms, such as interneuronal-mediated
signaling or passive diffusion of neuroactive substances through
extracellular fluid (5), have been proposed to contribute to the
spread of SD. In R192Q mice, a progressive spread of SD to
subcortical structures was observed particularly in slice 5 (bregma
−2.50 mm). Typically, the SD propagated ventrolaterally from the
dorsomedial cortex until reaching the entorhinal cortex, followed by
the delayed appearance of SD first in the ventral hippocampus and
then in the dorsal hippocampus. Similarly, this pattern of SD
propagation was observed in slice 6 in R192Q mice, with SD
spreading into the striatum (Figs. 2 and 3 and Movie S3). These
results suggest that failure-points where SD propagation is limited
normally exist between certain interconnected areas, for example
the entorhinal cortex–subiculum and piriform cortex–striatum, and
that a diffusional and/or synaptic barrier must be bridged for SD to
spread further. We speculate that neurons expressing CaV2.1
channels containing either R192Q or S218L mutations enable the
spread of SD across subcortical failure-points.
Hippocampal SD has been reported previously after direct
stimulation of the CA1 region in Sprague–Dawley rats (33), indicating that SD can indeed be initiated in this brain region but
likely does not receive sufficient input during cortical SD and/or
that a barrier in this region prevents the propagation of cortically
initiated SD. Invasion of SD into the striatum has been observed in
some rat models (34), and in our IOS slice preparation we regularly
observed SD invasion and initiation in the striatum of WT mice.
Because WT animals did not display subcortical SD in vivo, it is
likely that, like the hippocampus, the striatum is capable of SD but
cannot normally propagate the wave in response to adjacent cortical
SD. It has been suggested that in FHM-1 mice SD may spread to
the striatum and hippocampus via the amygdala and subiculum,
respectively, and that lower neuronal densities in these areas may be
responsible for limiting SD spread in WT animals (28). Our data
from R192Q animals support this view with respect to the anatomical entry point of SD into these structures for this strain. In
S218L mice, in which SD spreads immediately from the adjacent
cortex to subcortical structures, the stronger gain-of-function effect
of the mutation on CaV2.1 channels apparently generates an SD
wave that is sufficiently powerful to traverse the corpus callosum. Of
further interest is that SD is not observed to propagate into the
thalamus for either of the FHM-1 mutations, although this propagation has been reported to occur in a percentage of S218L mice
(28). It should be considered that in the study by EikermannHaerter et al. (28) the electrophysiological measurements of SD
were made under pentobarbital anesthesia, whereas our experiments were performed under isoflurane anesthesia; the two anesthetics may have distinct effects on SD invasion into the thalamus
(35). Despite this difference, both studies indicate that the white
matter of the internal capsule appears to be a particularly difficult
region for SD to traverse.
It is noteworthy that we did not observe SD in the cerebellum,
even when stimulation electrodes were placed directly into the
cerebellar cortex. In agreement with our findings, cerebellar SD
has not been reported previously in the FHM-1 mouse strains,
although it has been observed in rats (36). Strong cerebellar
symptoms in FHM-1 patients, including those with the S218L
mutation, are well described, and altered synaptic activity has
been reported in cerebellar synapses in S218L mice (12, 37). Our
results suggest that the FHM-1–mediated cerebellar symptoms
are not associated with functional changes that might occur as a
result of any recurrent SD within the cerebellum.
SD Threshold Is Increased by Pregabalin in WT but Not in FHM-1 Mice.
Gabapentin has been shown to increase the threshold for SD
in vivo (38), and we hypothesized that pregabalin also might alter
SD. Furthermore, gabapentin and pregabalin are known to bind to
the α2δ1/2 auxiliary subunit of CaV2.1 calcium channels, and gabapentinoid-mediated inhibition of calcium currents has been reported
both acutely (24, 30, 39) and via chronic effects on channel trafficking (25, 40). In the current study pregabalin was effective in
increasing the threshold for stimulation to induce SD in WT but
not R192Q or S218L mice. This finding suggests that pregabalin
may be an effective treatment for preventing migraine with aura
in migraineurs without FHM-1 mutations. In contrast, in FHM-1
patients the gain-of-function phenotypes conferred to CaV2.1
channels may be too severe for pregabalin to be therapeutically
efficacious. We did, however, observe a trend toward increased
threshold following acute pregabalin treatment in FHM-1 mice,
and therefore pregabalin should not necessarily be ruled out as
a chronically administered preventative treatment for FHM-1
patients.
Pregabalin Slows SD in FHM-1 Strains but Not in WT Mice. We
demonstrated that pregabalin slowed SD in S218L and R192Q
but not WT mice. As discussed, cortical synapses that express
CaV2.1 channels containing the R192Q and S218L mutations display enhanced excitatory, but not inhibitory, neurotransmission (16,
32), and a leftward shift in the activation curve of CaV2.1 channels
containing the S218L mutation allows calcium conduction at resting
membrane potentials (16). Together these characteristics would
permit subthreshold modulation of excitability by CaV2.1 in S218L
mice, providing a potential mechanism underlying the more severe
phenotype in this strain. Pregabalin has a direct inhibitory effect on
calcium-mediated glutamate release in brain slices from neocortex
(41) and entorhinal cortex (42). In addition, pregabalin displays
two- to threefold enhanced efficacy in the depression of noradrenaline release upon sustained depolarization as compared with
brief stimulation (26, 43). The long-lasting depolarization that occurs during SD may further increase the efficacy of pregabalin on
neurotransmitter release when attenuating the synaptic gain of
function resulting from R192Q and S218L mutations. Overall, pregabalin’s greater effectiveness in slowing SD speed in FHM-1 mice
than in WT mice directly supports our hypothesis that pregabalin has
a functional inhibitory effect on native CaV2.1 channels.
SD Invasion of Subcortical Structures Is Abolished by Pregabalin in
R192Q Mice. A notable finding from our DW-MRI experiments is
that pregabalin prevented the subcortical invasion of SD in four
of five R192Q animals. Given that pregabalin did not prevent
subcortical invasion in S218L mice, we would argue that pregabalin
suppresses excitability sufficiently to prevent SD propagation
through failure points that block the spread of SD into subcortical structures in the milder R192Q phenotype mice. Previous studies have demonstrated that pregabalin inhibits vesicle
trafficking in hippocampal neurons, reducing the readily releasable pool (44) and attenuating vesicle release (45). In hippocampal brain slices, we observed that pregabalin (500 μM)
effectively suppressed both spontaneous and evoked synaptic
activity in WT and R192Q CA1 neurons but not in S218L CA1
neurons. This strain-specific inhibition of evoked synaptic function provides a molecular mechanism for pregabalin to suppress
the invasion of the hippocampus in R192Q mice but not in S218L
mice. Although SD did not invade the hippocampus spontaneously
in WT mice, pregabalin’s efficacy on synaptic activity in WT CA1
neurons suggests that it may provide an effective preventative treatment to limit the subcortical progression of migraine in non–FHM-1
migraineurs and in milder forms of FHM-1.
In summary, we find that SD is limited to defined brain regions by as yet unknown synaptic and/or diffusional barriers involving CaV2.1 (P/Q-type) calcium channel-mediated excitability
and that these barriers can be bridged by the consequences of
FHM-1 mutations. Furthermore, pregabalin is effective in increasing the threshold for SD in WT animals, in slowing SD velocity in FHM-1 mice, and in preventing SD subcortical propagation
associated with the milder R192Q FHM-1 mutation. These findings
support the notion that pregabalin may be effective acutely but have

not addressed its effects with chronic drug administration. Although
gabapentin has recently fallen from favor as a preventative treatment in migraine (19), initial reports on the use of pregabalin are
encouraging (21–23). The current study provides insights into the
mechanism of action of pregabalin and supports its therapeutic
potential in both non-FHM migraineurs and patients with milder
FHM-1 mutations.
