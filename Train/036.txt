Notch signaling is central to vertebrate development, and analysis of Notch has provided important insights into pathogenetic
mechanisms in the CNS and many other tissues. However, surprisingly little is known about the role of Notch in the development
and pathology of Schwann cells and peripheral nerves. Using transgenic mice and cell cultures, we found that Notch has complex
and extensive regulatory functions in Schwann cells. Notch promoted the generation of Schwann cells from Schwann cell
precursors and regulated the size of the Schwann cell pool by controlling proliferation. Notch inhibited myelination, establishing
that myelination is subject to negative transcriptional regulation that opposes forward drives such as Krox20. Notably, in the
adult, Notch dysregulation resulted in demyelination; this finding identifies a signaling pathway that induces myelin breakdown
in vivo. These findings are relevant for understanding the molecular mechanisms that control Schwann cell plasticity and underlie
nerve pathology, including demyelinating neuropathies and tumorigenesis.

Schwann cells associate with axons in peripheral nerve trunks. They
control neuronal survival in the embryo, provide myelin that is
essential for normal movement and sensation in the adult, and control
regeneration and repair in injured nerves1–3.
Notch signaling is integral to the development of the main types of
glial cell in the CNS, including astrocytes, Müller cells, radial glia and
oligodendrocytes4,5, and Notch dysfunction has been implicated in a
range of CNS diseases, including tumorigenesis and neurodegeneration6,7. In view of this, it has become important to understand the role
of Notch in the development and pathology of Schwann cells, a system
in which the involvement of Notch is surprisingly poorly understood.
Here, we describe the role of Notch in the generation and amplification of Schwann cells in embryonic nerves; in myelination in perinatal
nerves; and in the dramatic response of Schwann cells to injury in
adult nerves.
For these studies we generated several mouse mutants with conditional activation or inactivation of Notch signaling at different stages of
the Schwann cell lineage (see Supplementary Fig. 1 online for the
Notch pathway and our strategy). We focused on limb nerves in which
the key transitions of the lineage have been unambiguously established
(Supplementary Fig. 2 online)1. First, Schwann cell precursors (SCPs),
which occupy mouse limb nerves at embryo day (E) 12/13 (E14/15 in
the rat), are formed from neural crest cells. Second, immature Schwann
cells, which occupy nerves from E15/16 (E17/18 in the rat), are
generated. At this stage, axon/Schwann cell numbers are matched by

regulation of Schwann cell proliferation and death. Third, immature
cells diverge to form myelinating and non-myelinating cells. Before
myelination, which starts around birth, axons and promyelin Schwann
cells establish a 1:1 relationship from the irregular groups of axons and
Schwann cells (Schwann cell families) that characterize embryonic
nerves. This process is known as radial sorting2. Remarkably, in injured
adult nerves, mature Schwann cells can dedifferentiate to a phenotype
related to that of the immature Schwann cell8–10.
We find that in embryonic nerves Notch accelerates the generation of
Schwann cells from SCPs and regulates the size of the Schwann cell pool
by controlling proliferation, without affecting apoptosis. In perinatal
nerves, Notch acts as a brake to delay myelination, without affecting
radial sorting. This finding establishes in vivo that myelination is subject
to negative transcriptional regulation that opposes forward drivers of
the process such as the key myelin transcription factor Krox20. Significantly, in adult nerves, Notch dysregulation results in demyelination.
This represents, to the best of our knowledge, the first identification of a
signaling pathway that induces myelin breakdown in vivo. These data
establish that Notch regulates every developmental step of the Schwann
cell lineage and controls pathological conditions in adult nerves.
RESULTS
Notch signaling and gliogenesis
Notch signaling in Schwann cells has mainly been studied in the context
of initial gliogenesis from the neural crest or from crest-like cells2. Even

here, the role of Notch remains unclear, as Notch activation in cultured
crest cells promotes glial differentiation in rat11, but not chick12,
whereas Notch activation in the neural crest in ovo fails to promote
the generation of Schwann cells13.
When we examined spinal nerves in mouse embryos lacking Hes 1
and/or Hes 5, the effectors of canonical Notch signaling14, we found no
significant effect on SCP formation (Fig. 1a and Supplementary Table 1
online). Consistent with this, Schwann cell generation is reported to
occur in mice with neural crest-selective ablation of RBPJ15, the key
transcriptional mediator of canonical Notch signaling14, although the
development of satellite cells and ganglia is impaired.
In vitro, we failed to induce expression of the early glial (SCP) marker
protein zero (P0) by infecting crest cells with an adenovirus expressing
NICD, the active intracellular portion of the Notch receptor14 (AdNICD). In parallel experiments, P0 was readily induced by the gliogenic
signal retinoic acid (Fig. 1b). These experiments indicate that the first
step in the generation of Schwann cells, namely the appearance of SCPs,
does not depend on canonical Notch signals.
Notch pathway components in the Schwann cell lineage
To determine the potential importance of the Notch pathway in the rest
of the Schwann cell lineage, we showed that its components are
expressed in rat sciatic nerves at different ages (Fig. 2a,b). Immunolabeling of teased nerves and freshly dissociated cells confirmed that
the Notch ligand Jagged 1 was expressed by axons and glia, whereas
Notch 1 was detected only on glial cells (Fig. 2c).
Figure 2 Notch signaling pathway molecules are expressed at different stages
in the Schwann cell lineage. (a) PCR of Notch pathway components in rat
sciatic nerves at E14 (SCPs), E18 (immature Schwann cells) and P3–15
(active myelination). Notch 1 mRNA increases between E14 and E18/P3,
and decreases afterwards. Notch 2 and Notch 3 mRNA is not detectable at
E14 but found from E18 onwards. Hes1 is high at E14 and at E18 but lower
postnatally. Numb and Numblike mRNAs are low at E14 but detectable from
E18 onwards. Gapdh: loading control. (b) PCR of Notch ligands in rat DRGs.
Delta 1 and 3 are expressed only at E15, whereas Jagged 1 and 2 are
expressed at E15 and birth but decrease thereafter. Gapdh: loading control.
(c) Expression of Notch 1 and Jagged 1 in E14 and at birth (NB) teased
sciatic nerves, and in SCP and Schwann cell cultures. Notch 1 (green) is
expressed by SCP and Schwann cells (arrowheads) but is absent from axons
in teased nerves (arrows), identified by neurofilament (NF; red). Jagged 1
(green) is seen on axons (arrows) and by SCP and Schwann cells
(arrowheads). L1 and S100b were used to identify SCP and Schwann cells,
respectively, in dissociated cultures. (d) Western blot of NICD in rat sciatic

Figure 1 Notch signaling is not involved in the generation of SCPs from
neural crest cells. (a) Disruption of canonical Notch signaling does not impair
gliogenesis in spinal nerves. Both control and mutant embryos express the
SCP marker BFABP1,2 (red) in embryonic nerves (arrowheads) in E11
Hes1/ and Hes5/, and E10 Hes1/Hes5/ mice. The neural tube is
disorganized in Hes1/Hes5/ mice39 but BFABP+ cells are still associated
with peripheral nerves. Insets: the sections were double immunolabeled
with TUJ1 antibodies that bind to class III b-tubulin (green) in axons
(arrowheads). DRGs (asterisk) are also BFABP+. S, spinal cord. The
percentage of cells (Hoechst+ nuclei) in ventral roots or spinal nerves
that express BFABP was not statistically different between control and
mutant embryos (quantification: Supplementary Table 1). (b) Notch
activation in rat neural crest cells (NCCs) does not upregulate the SCP
marker P0. NCCs (1 d after emigration from neural tube) do not express P0
mRNA or protein, whereas freshly isolated SCPs express both. Culture of
NCCs in retinoic acid (100 ng ml1) for 3 d (NCC + RA) upregulates P0
mRNA and protein, reflecting in vitro gliogenesis. Notch activation in NCCs,
by adenoviral infection (NCC + Ad-NICD), does not upregulate P0 mRNA or
protein after 3 d.

Notch receptors in developing Schwann cells could therefore be
activated by Notch ligands on axons or on the glial cells themselves. The
finding that these nerves contain high levels of NICD (Fig. 2d) is
also consistent with active Notch signaling in embryonic and early
postnatal nerves.
Notch drives differentiation of Schwann cell precursors

SCPs to Schwann cells by examining three changes that mark this

Notch controls Schwann cell proliferation and numbers
Schwann cell generation from SCPs occurs during a period of
increasing cell proliferation2,21,22 that peaks at the immature
Schwann cell stage, a time of maximal NICD expression (Fig. 2d),
indicating that Notch might drive Schwann cell proliferation. When
we conditionally deleted RBPJ or Notch 1 using P0-cre+ mice
(Supplementary Figs. 1 and 2), we found a marked reduction in
proliferation (incorporation of 5-bromodeoxyuridine (BrdU) and
phosphohistone (PH3) labeling) in both mouse lines (Fig. 4a–c and
Supplementary Table 3 online).
To confirm this, we examined proliferation in mice with activated
NICD in Schwann cells (P0-cre+ mice bred with CALSL-NICD mice;
Supplementary Figs. 1 and 2). Even though cells in control nerves
proliferated rapidly, both BrdU incorporation and PH3 labeling
were significantly increased in this mutant (Fig. 4d,e and Supplementary Table 3).
When we counted Schwann cell nuclei in ultra-thin sections of P2
nerves, we found that in all three mutants Schwann cell numbers
changed in line with expectations. There was a reduction of 30% and
18% in P0cre+RBPJ f/f mice and P0cre+Notch1f/f mice, respectively, and
an increase of 13% in P0cre+CALSL-NICD mice (Fig. 4c,f and Supplementary Table 3). These findings indicate that the canonical Notch
pathway is mitogenic for Schwann cells and that NICD elevation is part
of the mechanism that controls proliferation and numbers in
developing nerves.

To show this directly, we examined proliferation in immunopurified
cultured Schwann cells after Notch activation. We found that BrdU
incorporation was strongly stimulated by either infection with
Ad-NICD (Fig. 4g) or co-culture with the immortalized cell line
3T3, expressing the Notch ligand, Delta 1 (data not shown).
To confirm that Notch stimulates proliferation, we used cells that
lack RBPJ (RBPJnull; RBPJ f/f cells treated in vitro with Cre adenovirus).
Ad-NICD did not induce DNA synthesis in these cells, unlike NRG1
(Fig. 4h,i). The reduced proliferation observed in vivo in mice that lack
RBPJ (P0-cre+RBPJ f/f mice) therefore reflects reduced Notch, but not
NRG1, signaling.
Enforced NICD expression also upregulated the cell cycle markers
cyclin D1 and cdk2 (Fig. 4j). The mitogenic effect of NICD on Schwann
cells involved and depended on phosphorylation of the kinases ERK1/2
and JNK, but not p38 kinase (Fig. 4k,l). Apoptotic cell death2,23
(measured by TdT-mediated dUTP nick end (TUNEL) labeling)
was unaffected in E17 nerves of the three Notch mutants (Supplementary Fig. 3 online). In embryonic nerves, therefore, Notch signaling
controls Schwann cell proliferation and numbers, but not apoptotic
cell death.
Krox20 suppresses Notch signaling in myelinating cells
We next investigated Notch signaling in perinatal nerves during
myelination. This process, which starts around birth, is incompatible
with proliferation, and most Schwann cells have stopped dividing as
they reach the pro-myelin 1:1 stage and start significant myelin
gene activation2,21,24.
Using fluorescence activated cell sorting (FACS) to separate myelinating cells from cells that are not making myelin in P5 nerves, we
found that Notch signaling (which drives proliferation) is inactivated
in myelinating cells in vivo (Fig. 5a). This is consistent with the
downregulation of NICD protein at the start of myelination in
postnatal nerves (Fig. 2d).
The transcription factor Krox20 activates myelin genes and
suppresses genes associated with immature Schwann cells1,25–27.
We found that Krox20 suppressed Notch signaling in myelinating
cells, as in culture, enforced Krox20 expression by adenoviral
infection (Ad-K20) suppressed NICD protein, and in vivo, NICD
levels remained high in P7 Krox20–/– animals, but low in normal
nerves (Fig. 5b,c).

Enforced Krox20 expression also suppressed exogenous NICD in
Schwann cells (after stable infection with a retrovirus encoding
NICD) showing that Krox20 can reduce NICD protein posttranslationally (Fig. 5d). This depended on the ubiquitinproteasomal degradation pathway (Fig. 5e). As expected, because
Krox20 suppresses NICD post-translationally, the enhanced NICD
levels in P0-cre+CALSL-NICD nerves (Supplementary Fig. 2)
declined postnatally, when Krox20 was activated upon myelination
(Fig. 5f).
Notch signaling times the onset of myelination
Because Notch drives proliferation and is downregulated in myelinating cells, we tested whether Notch inhibits myelination. In vitro,
upregulation of the myelin proteins periaxin and P0 by enforced
Krox20 expression was inhibited by simultaneous infection with
Ad-NICD (Supplementary Fig. 4 online). The inhibition was transient, as expected, because Krox20 eventually suppresses exogenous
NICD expression (Fig. 5d). Enforced NICD expression also blocked
cAMP-induced upregulation of myelin proteins28,29 (Supplementary
Fig. 4), and myelination in neurone-Schwann cell co-cultures27
(Supplementary Fig. 5 online). Notch therefore negatively regulates
myelination in vitro.

To determine whether Notch is part of the mechanism that times
the onset of myelination in vivo, we examined nerves from P0cre+CALSL-NICD mice, in which NICD levels are transiently
elevated (Fig. 5f). We counted the number of myelin sheaths in
each nerve profile in P2 nerves, and divided this by the number of
Schwann cell nuclei (because NICD affects cell numbers), to obtain
a normalized number of myelin sheaths (NNMS). This was reduced
from 2.3 in controls to 1.4 in mutants (n ¼ 10, P o 0.01; Fig. 5g
and Supplementary Table 4 online). We measured myelin
thickness in P5 nerves, and found that mutant nerves contained
significantly more Schwann cells with thin myelin and fewer
Schwann cells with thick myelin than controls (Fig. 5h and
Supplementary Table 4). Both measures therefore revealed a
significant reduction in myelination in the mutants. P2
mutant nerves also contained less P0 protein (Supplementary
Fig. 5). Adult mutant nerves, however, had normal g-ratios
(axon diameter to fiber diameter), axon diameters and numbers
of myelinated axons, reflecting the transient NICD elevation in
perinatal nerves (Supplementary Fig. 6 online).
To confirm that Notch inhibits myelination independently of
proliferation, we selectively examined Schwann cells that had
already segregated from the Schwann cell families found in
developing nerves and formed a 1:1 relationship with axons (pro–
myelin cells plus myelinating cells), because proliferation has essentially ceased in these cells2,21,24. Within this population, we found a
substantial (30%) reduction in the number of myelinating cells,
and a corresponding increase in pro-myelin cells (Supplementary Table 4). This is the expected outcome if NICD inhibits myelination, that is, the transition of pro-myelin cells to
myelinating cells.
We compared this inhibitory effect of NICD in two genetic backgrounds: normal Krox20+/+ and Krox20+/– mice. Again examining
the segregated cells only, we found that the NICD-induced reduction
in myelinating cells seen in the normal background (Krox20+/+ mice)
was more pronounced in Krox20+/– mice; myelin sheaths were
also substantially thinner (Fig. 5i,j). There was no difference in
myelination between Krox20+/+ and Krox20+/– control nerves. Thus,
myelination defects in P0-cre+CALSL-NICD mice were amplified on a
Krox20+/– background.

Because Notch activation delays myelination, we tested whether,
conversely, Notch inactivation in vivo would accelerate it. In
P0-cre+Notch1f/f mice, where Notch 1 has been excised, the myelin
sheaths in P5 nerves were significantly thicker than in controls (Fig. 6a
and Supplementary Table 5 online). In P2 nerves, there was also a 40%
increase in the NNMS. Analysis of segregated cells revealed a striking
increase (70%) in the ratio of myelinating cells to pro-myelin cells,
confirming that this increase in myelination was independent of
proliferation (Supplementary Table 5). Thus, myelination is substantially accelerated in Schwann cells that lack Notch 1. These experiments
show that Notch is a negative regulator of myelination and Krox20dependent downregulation of Notch signaling is obligatory for the
normal onset of myelination.
Notch controls myelination by RBPJ–independent mechanisms
Although RBPJ is an important downstream effector of Notch, in
some cases, an elevation in NICD can signal independently of
RBPJ30,31. We found that, by any of our measures, P0-cre+RBPJ f/f
mice had normal myelin, in contrast to that seen in mice without
Notch 1 (Fig. 6b and Supplementary Table 6 online). In cultured
Schwann cells, Ad-NICD could also suppress cAMP- and Krox20induced myelin protein expression, even in the absence of RBPJ
(Fig. 6c–f). Adult nerves from both P0-cre+Notch1 f/f and P0cre+RBPJ f/f mice were normal (Supplementary Fig. 6). Therefore,
the negative regulation of myelination by Notch is independent of
RBPJ, in contrast to the positive regulation of Schwann cell generation and proliferation, which work through the canonical RBPJdependent pathway.
Notch drives Schwann cell demyelination in injured nerves
Remarkably, mature myelinating Schwann cells in adult nerves
can dedifferentiate and adopt a phenotype related to that of
immature Schwann cells8–10. Because Notch acts as a brake to delay
myelination, we tested whether Notch was also involved in driving

premature myelination. (a) Frequency of Schwann cells with different myelin

demyelination, a key feature of dedifferentiation. First, we found that
infection of P5 Schwann cell cultures with Ad-NICD accelerated the
normal loss of myelin in vitro (Fig. 7a). Second, NICD protein
was strongly upregulated in the distal stump of transected
nerves 1 and 2 d after they were cut (Fig. 7b), a prerequisite for
functional involvement of Notch in dedifferentiation. Third, in the
absence of RBPJ the rate of demyelination in cut sciatic nerves
was substantially reduced. The number of intact myelin sheaths
was 80% higher and the area occupied by MBP+ myelin 70%
greater in nerves lacking RBPJ 3 d after transection (Fig. 7c,d). Similar
results were obtained in mice lacking Notch 1 (Supplementary
Fig. 7 online).
In the transected facial nerve, the number of cells in the distal stump
that retained expression of MBP and the myelin transcription factor
Krox20 3 d after transection was also significantly higher in the absence
of RBPJ. Furthermore, the number of cells that expressed p75NTR, a
marker of immature and non-myelinating cells1,2, was significantly
reduced, indicating delayed reversal to the immature phenotype
(Supplementary Fig. 8 online). These observations show that without
canonical RBPJ-dependent Notch signaling, the rate of Schwann cell
dedifferentiation in cut nerves is reduced.
To show directly that Notch can accelerate demyelination in vivo, we
examined myelin disappearance in cut nerves of P0-cre+CALSL-NICD
mice. First, we confirmed that nerve transection in these mice elevated
NICD when compared with cut control nerves (Fig. 7e). This was
expected because nerve injury will trigger expression of both the
endogenous NICD (Fig. 7b) and the CALSL-NICD transgene, both
of which are suppressed in intact nerves through a Krox-20-dependent
mechanism (Fig. 5e,f). This increase in NICD resulted in accelerated
dedifferentiation. The P0-cre+CALSL-NICD nerves contained 50%
fewer intact myelinating Schwann cells and the area occupied by
MBP+ myelin was 50% smaller than in cut control nerves 3 d after
transection (Fig. 7f,g). These experiments show that Notch
signaling drives demyelination in injured nerves through an RBPJdependent mechanism.
Notch initiates demyelination even in uncut nerves
In demyelinating neuropathies, demyelination occurs even though
Schwann cells remain in contact with axons until the later stages
when axons die32,33. The results shown in Figure 7 raise the question
of whether Notch activation is sufficient to trigger demyelination in
cells that maintain axonal contact. Initially, we addressed this by
showing that infection of established myelinating co-cultures of
neurons and Schwann cells with Ad-NICD resulted in myelin
damage and apparent breakdown in a high proportion of infected
cells, whereas very few Ad-GFP-infected cells had disrupted
myelin (Fig. 8a).

We obtained the same result in adult nerves in vivo when
we injected intact nerves with Ad-NICD or Ad-GFP. Quantification
of demyelination 10 d later showed that Notch activation induced

extensive demyelination, revealed by a sixfold increase in the
number of degenerating myelin sheaths and 90% loss of
MBP+ myelin (Fig. 8b,c). These results indicate that tight
control of Notch signaling is essential for the maintenance of
myelin integrity.
DISCUSSION
We show that Notch signaling has multiple regulatory functions in
Schwann cells that operate right across the lineage, from the SCPs in
early embryonic nerves to the control of responses to injury in mature
cells. Notch stimulates SCP differentiation and accelerates Schwann cell
formation and proliferation in perinatal nerves, inhibits further differentiation and induces dedifferentiation in the adult. On one hand,
therefore, the actions of Notch are strikingly pleiotropic and contextdependent. On the other hand, these diverse effects work towards one
related biological outcome: the generation of the immature Schwann
cell state in development or its closely related counterpart, the
denervated Schwann cell in the adult. The role of Notch in the plasticity
of postnatal Schwann cells indicates that it might be involved in the
numerous Schwann cell disorders that involve dedifferentiation,
including tumor formation and demyelinating neuropathies, and raises
the possibility that the Notch pathway is relevant for the regeneration
of damaged nerves.

ARTICLES
Schwann cell generation
Rather than instructing gliogenesis from the trunk neural crest, we find
that Notch signaling acts at the second step of Schwann cell development by promoting the formation of immature Schwann cells from
SCPs. SCPs are distinct from migrating neural crest cells because, first,
they express glia-associated genes, including P0, desert hedgehog and
BFABP; second, they differ from crest cells in survival and proliferative
responses to extracellular signals; and third, unlike crest cells, they are
always in tight apposition to axons, a universal characteristic of glia in
the PNS and CNS. Global gene expression analysis also shows that a
large group of genes is differentially expressed between SCPs and
migratory neural crest cells1,2. Using five independent criteria in
in vivo and culture experiments, we find that Notch inactivation in
these cells retards their differentiation into immature Schwann cells
whereas Notch activation accelerates it.
Our data can be reconciled with the apparent promotion by
Notch of Schwann cell generation from neural crest or crest-like
cells, rather than from SCPs, in 14-d assays using the Schwann
cell marker GFAP11,13. In these experiments, it is plausible
that the long period in complex medium allowed some crest
cells to generate SCPs. In such cultures, Notch activation would
lead to the observed increase in Schwann cells by promoting the transition from SCPs to Schwann cells rather than
by acting on neural crest cells, and by stimulating Schwann
cell proliferation.
Indirect support for the importance of Notch at this point in
development comes from the fact that sensitivity to Notch signaling
and Notch expression are much higher at the SCP stage than in
migrating crest cells11. Thus, we conclude that Notch regulates
Schwann cell generation at the SCP–Schwann cell transition.
Schwann cell proliferation
Our data establish canonical Notch signaling as an important positive
regulator of Schwann cell proliferation and numbers. The decrease in
Schwann cell numbers after Notch inactivation (P0-cre+RBPJ f/f and P0cre+Notch1f/f mice) was mirrored in a quantitatively similar reduction
(by 38% and 16% respectively, P o 0.05) in the total number of
segregated axon–Schwann cell units (pro-myelinating plus myelinating). This relationship between axonal segregation, and therefore the
number of cells available for myelination, and total cell numbers has
not been demonstrated before to our knowledge.
It follows that the extent of myelination in early nerves is a function
of Schwann cell numbers. Notch is, however, unlikely to be involved in
the mechanism of segregation itself, because the ratio of segregated cells
(pro-myelinating and myelinating) to total cells is not significantly
different between Notch-inactivated and control nerves (5.3 ± 0.2 and
5.9 ± 0.3 in P0-cre+RBPJ f/f mice and controls, respectively, and 6.1 ± 0.3
and 6.0 ± 0.4 in P0-cre+Notch1 f/f mice and controls, respectively).
Therefore, the probability of an axon segregating does not vary
according to whether Notch signaling is present.
Negative regulation of myelination
Previous experiments have identified a set of positive transcriptional
regulators of myelination, namely Krox20, Sox-10, Oct-6 and Brn2, the
inactivation of which delay or prevent myelination in vivo1,34. The
present results establish that the transcriptional regulation of myelination during development also incorporates a negative regulatory
component. We find that inactivation of Notch 1 promotes in vivo
myelination and Notch activation delays it. This delay is inversely
proportional to levels of the key positive regulator Krox20, indicating
that a balance between positive and negative regulatory mechanisms is

846

used to time the onset of myelination. In oligodendrocytes, Notch also
negatively regulates myelination in vitro35 and reduced levels of Notch 1
result in premature myelination in vivo36. In addition, it has been
proposed that Notch activation in oligodendrocyte precursors inhibits
their maturation into myelinating oligodendrocytes in multiple
sclerosis plaques37.
We find no enhanced myelination in nerves lacking RBPJ, in contrast
to that seen in nerves without Notch1. Experiments on individual cells
also show that NICD does not require RBPJ to inhibit the effects of the
pro-myelin signals cAMP or Krox20. Together these results reveal an
RPBJ-independent signaling pathway that acts as a brake on myelination. Although Notch times two key transitions, from SCPs to
immature Schwann cells and immature Schwann cells to myelinating
cells, the mechanisms of these two processes are notably different. The
first involves RBPJ-dependent promotion of differentiation, whereasthe second involves RBPJ-independent inhibition of differentiation.
Myelin stability and breakdown in cut and normal nerves
After injury to adult nerves, Schwann cells lose their myelin sheaths and
dedifferentiate to a phenotype related to that of immature Schwann
cells8–10. This is accompanied by a sharp increase in NICD. The
Notch ligands Jagged 1 and 2 are also upregulated (A.W., R.M. and
K.R.J., unpublished data), but it is not known whether the Schwann
cells themselves, macrophages or other cells activate Notch in Schwann
cells under these conditions.
In injured nerves, NICD accelerates myelin breakdown. This is
severely retarded in the absence of either RBPJ or Notch1 and therefore
depends on the canonical RBPJ pathway. The finding that Notch
activates different mechanisms to negatively regulate myelination
during development and injury was unexpected. It indicates that,
more generally, the molecular machinery that controls adult Schwann
cell plasticity might differ significantly from the machinery that
regulates development.
The present experiments and other recent work indicate that myelin
breakdown and other aspects of Schwann cell dedifferentiation are
controlled through the activation of a group of transcriptional regulators. In addition to Notch, in vivo evidence for this type of function
exists for c-Jun27, and Sox-2, Pax-3 and Id2 might also be involved in
Schwann cell dedifferentiation1,8. We therefore suggest that Schwann
cells contain a set of negative transcriptional regulators that functionally complement the previously established positive regulatory proteins
and that myelination and demyelination are determined by a balance
between two opposing transcriptional programs1,8.
The ability of Notch signaling to shift this balance and to drive
myelinating cells towards demyelination is shown by the observation
that activation of NICD in myelinating cells even of intact, uncut nerves
results in severe demyelination. This finding shows that myelin stability
and the maintenance of the myelinated state depend crucially on
continuous inhibition of Notch signaling. It will be important to
determine whether enhanced Notch signaling is a component of the
pathogenetic mechanisms in inherited or acquired demyelinating
neuropathies. In addition, the fact that Notch is mitogenic in Schwann
cells raises the question of whether aberrant Notch activation could
lead to the formation of Schwann cell tumors. In support of this idea,
Notch can induce transformation in long-term cultured rat Schwann
cells that can generate tumors when injected into nude rats38 and Notch
acts as an oncogene in a number of cancers, including brain tumors6.

ONLINE METHODS
Animals. We used a cre/lox strategy to inactivate Notch signaling. To delete
RBPJ in SCPs, mice homozygous for the RBPJf/f locus40 were crossed with mice
in which Cre expression is controlled by desert hedgehog regulatory sequences
and directed to SCPs around E12 (Dhh-cre+ mice)41. The Dhh-cre+RBPJ f/+
offspring were backcrossed with RBPJ f/f mice to generate Dhh-cre+RBPJ f/f
(mutants) and Dhh-cre–RBPJ f/f (controls). To delete Notch1, we used mice
homozygous for the Notch1 f/f locus42.
For Notch activation in SCPs, we crossed CALSL-NICD transgenic mice, in
which transcription of an NICD transgene is blocked by an upstream floxed
‘stop–cassette’43, with Dhh-cre+ mice to generate Dhh-Cre+NICD (mutants)
and Dhh-creNICD (controls). To activate or inactivate Notch signaling in
Schwann cells, the same strategy was used, except that mice in which Cre
expression is controlled by the P0 gene and activated selectively in Schwann cells
around E15 (P0-cre+ mice)44, were used in place of Dhh-cre+ mice to generate
the various mutants. Supplementary Figure 2 shows cre expression and
recombination efficiency in mutants.
Hes 1, Hes 5 and Krox20 null mice, and Hes1Hes5 double null mice have been
described25,39. Primers for genotyping and recombination experiments are in
Supplementary Table 7 online. Time-mated females, postnatal and adult rats
and imprinting control region (ICR) mice were from the Biological Services
Unit at UCL.
Electron microscopy and morphometric analyses. Processing of nerves and
analyses of morphometry, G–ratios and axon diameters in adults were as
described27,45,46. For early myelination studies, images of whole P2 and P5
nerves were acquired and analyzed using NIH ImageJ. At P2, the number of
myelin sheaths (MS) per nerve profile was counted andeither divided by the
number of Schwann cells, identified by their nuclei and association with axons,
to obtain the normalized number of myelin sheaths (NNMS), or expressed as a
ratio of the number of pro-myelinating Schwann cells (PS; non-myelinating
Schwann cells in a 1:1 relationship with an axon) (MS per PS). In P5 nerves, we
determined the axon diameter and myelin thickness of about 500 sheaths
and calculated the proportion of Schwann cells within defined myelin
thickness ranges.
Nerve transection. Nerve transection was performed as described, according to
UK Home Office guidelines27,47. Distal stumps and the control uninjured
contralateral nerves were processed for western blotting, immunohistochemistry (IHC) or electron microscopy (EM) analysis, or dissociated and
plated on coverslips for immunolabeling. For EM analysis, images of the whole
nerve were acquired and the number of intact myelin sheaths counted and
expressed as a percentage of the total number of myelinating Schwann cells in
the uninjured contralateral nerve. For IHC, paraffin sections were immunolabeled for MBP and confocal pictures of the whole nerve acquired. The MBP+
myelin area was calculated and expressed as a percentage of MBP+ myelin in the
uninjured contralateral nerve using NIH ImageJ.

needle using an inverted microscope, leaving the neural crest cells attached to
the dish. The cells were then dissociated by incubating for 3 min in 200 ml
versene (0.2 mg ml–1 EDTA, 0.01% PBS, 0.005% Phenol Red in ultra
pure deionized water) containing three drops of enzyme cocktail (collagenase
(2 mg ml–1), hyaluronidase (1.2 mg ml–1) and trypsin inhibitor (0.3 mg ml–1)
in DMEM). After centrifugation the cells were resuspended in the relevant
medium and plated.
Schwann cell precursor cultures. We dissected sciatic nerves from E14 rat
embryos and incubated them for 1 h in enzyme cocktail at 37 1C. The cell
suspension was centrifuged and resuspended in DM supplemented with NRG1
(10 ng ml–1) and insulin (109 M).
Serum-purified Schwann cell cultures. Sciatic nerves were dissected from
newborn or postnatal day 3 (P3) rats and dissociated by digestion in 0.25%
trypsin, 0.4% collagenase in DMEM at 37 1C and 5%CO2 and 95% air for
35 min with trituration at the end. The cell suspension was then centrifuged
and cultured for 3 d in DMEM containing 10% FCS (FCS) and cytosine
arabisnoside (AraC) (103 M), which kills contaminating fibroblasts. After 3 d
in culture, more than 95% of the cells are Schwann cells.
Neuron/Schwann cell co-cultures. We prepared co-cultures of neurons and
myelinating Schwann cells by adding together purified E15 rat DRG neurons
and purified neonatal Schwann cells27 stably infected with an NICD-expressing
retrovirus. Myelination was induced by adding 50 mg ml–1 ascorbic acid to the
medium, which contained DM, 10% FCS and NGF (50 ng ml–1). We used P0
antibodies to immunolabel myelin segments.
For demyelination assays, organotypic DRG/SC co-cultures were set up and
myelination induced with ascorbic acid over two weeks. Thereafter, the cultures
were infected with Ad-GFP or Ad-NICD adenovirus. At 3 and 6 d after
infection, the cultures were fixed and immunolabeled with MBP antibodies.
The number of GFP+ cells with damaged myelin profiles was counted and
expressed as a percentage of the total number of myelin segments.
Viral constructs. Adenoviral constructs expressing GFP/Krox20 (Ad-K20) and
its matched GFP control (Ad-GFP) were a gift from J. Milbrandt (Washington
University, St. Louis, Missouri)26,27. Adenoviral constructs expressing GFP/
NICD (Ad-NICD) and its matched GFP control (Ad-GFP) were a gift from
G.P. Dotto (University of Lausanne, Epaninges, Switzerland)48. The cDNAs for
NICD, obtained by PCR from the full-length human Notch1 cDNA (amino
acids 1760–2566) and the cDNAs for mouse full length Delta 1 (amino acids
14–2190) were cloned into the retroviral plasmid vector pBABEpuro, and the
GP+E ectotropic packaging cell line was then stably transfected with the
plasmid DNA. We used plasmids without the transgene as a control vector.
Retroviral supernatant obtained from the infected GP+E cells was used to infect
confluent cells, followed by puromycin (1 mg ml–1) selection.
Inhibitors. Specific inhibitors used were: UO126 (ERK 1/2 phosphorylation
inhibitor; 10 mM, Calbiochem), SB202190 (p38 phosphorylation inhibitor;
10 mM, Calbiochem), JNK peptide (JNK 1/2 phosphorylation inhibitor;
10 mM, a gift from H. Mehmet (Imperial College, London, UK27)), MG132
(10 mM, Calbiochem) and lactacystein (10 mM, Calbiochem).

In vivo adenoviral infections. We exposed sciatic nerves of anaesthetized P60
ICR mice and injected 1 ml of Ad-NICD or Ad-GFP (1012 virions ml1) into
the endoneurium (ten animals per group). The nerves were dissected out 10 d
later, teased onto microscope slides and immunolabeled for MBP. Confocal
pictures of the infected Schwann cells (GFP expression) and myelin (MBP
expression) were acquired and analyzed. To determine the extent of Notch–
induced myelin breakdown, we counted the number of GFP+ Schwann cells
with damaged myelin profiles. We also determined the area of MBP+ myelin
occupied by GFP+ cells using NIH Image J.

cAMP myelination assay. A cAMP analog, dibutryl cAMP (103 M), was
added to cultures, as mentioned in the text. The cells were then fixed after 1 d
for Krox20 ICC, 2 d for periaxin ICC or 3 d for P0 ICC26,27.

Neural crest cell cultures. Neural tubes from E11 rat embryos were dissected
out and plated on a PDL-fibronectin coated 35-mm Petri dish containing 2 ml
of defined medium (DM) (1:1 mixture of DMEM and Ham’s F12, supplemented with transferrin (100 mg ml1), progesterone (60 ng ml–1), putrescine
(16 mg ml–1), thyroxine (0.4 mg ml–1), tri-iodothyronine (10.1 ng ml–1),
dexamethasone (38 ng ml–1), selenium (160 ng ml–1), BSA (0.3 mg ml–1),
penicillin (100 IU ml–1), streptomycin (100 IU ml–1) and glutamine (2 mM))
supplemented with NRG1 (10 ng ml–1), IGF1 (100 ng ml–1), N-acetyl cysteine
(1 mM), FGF2 (3 ng ml–1) and insulin (109 M). Explants were cultured for
24 h at 37 1C and 5% CO2 after which the neural tubes were excised with a

Fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS). We separated immunopanned P5
Schwann cells into myelinating and non-myelinating populations by FACS47.
Schwann cells were isolated from 10 P5 rat pups, purified by immunopanning
with OX-7 antibodies, immunolabeled with antibodies against GalC, which at
this age is expressed by myelinating Schwann cells but not by non-myelinating
Schwann cells49, and then sorted using a Becton-Dickinson FACSCalibur
machine (BD), which first sorted the live cells from the dead cells and then
separated the fluorescent (GalC+) from the non-fluorescent cells (GalC–).
The two populations were collected and the mRNA extracted and processed
for RT-PCR.

Immunohistochemistry (IHC) and immunocytochemistry (ICC). For frozen
sections, samples were fixed for 4 h in 4% PFA, placed in 30% sucrose
overnight, frozen in OCT and sectioned (10 mm) using a cryostat. For paraffin
sections, samples were fixed in PFA in PBS at 4 1C overnight, dehydrated and
embedded in paraffin wax. Paraffin sections (5 mm) were rehydrated and
subjected to antigen retrieval in 10 mM sodium citrate buffer (pH 6.0). For
teased nerves, nerves were dissected out, immediately fixed in 4% PFA in PBS
for 10 min, teased on microscope slides and allowed to dry.
The samples were incubated in 0.2% triton in blocking solution (BS: PBS
containing 10% FCS, 0.1% lysine and 0.02% sodium azide) followed by
overnight incubation at 4 1C with the following primary antibodies: BFABP
(rabbit, 1:5000); TUJ1 (mouse, 1:5000, Covance); S100b (rabbit, 1:1000,
Dakopatts); AP2a (rabbit, 1:1000; Santa Cruz Biotechnology); MBP (mouse,
1:500, Sternberger Monoclonals); Jagged 1 (rabbit, 1:200, Santa Cruz Biotechnology); Notch 1 (hamster, 1:100, Upstate); and neurofilament (mouse, 1:50).
For S100b and AP2a IHC, HRP-conjugated secondary antibodies were used
followed by HRP substrate, diaminobenzidine. For other IHC, secondary
antibodies for detection of rabbit or mouse antibodies were labeled by
fluorescence (FITC or Cy3; Cappel MP biomedicals or Jackson Immunoresearch Labs).
For GFAP and nestin ICC, cultures were fixed with 4% PFA in PBS for 10
min, permeabilized with methanol (20 1C) for 10 min and the following
primary antibodies applied overnight at 4 1C: GFAP (rabbit, 1:200, Dakopatts);
nestin (mouse, 1:2000, Developmental Studies Hybridoma Bank). Krox20,
periaxin and P0 ICC procedures were as described26,27. For O4 antigen/L1
ICC or p75NTR ICC, unfixed cells were incubated with O4 hybridoma supernatant (mouse, 1:1), and L1 hybridoma supernatant (rat, 1:1) or p75NTR
antibody (rabbit, 1:200, Cell Signaling Technology) diluted in MEM-Hepes/
10% FCS for 1 h, followed by application of appropriate secondary antibodies
and post-fixation with 4% PFA in PBS for 5 min.
Apoptotic cells were detected by TUNEL labeling. Proliferative cells were
detected in vivo in E17 sciatic nerves by BrdU incorporation and immunolabeling or PH3 immunolabeling and in vitro were detected by BrdU incorporation46. P0 in situ hybridization has been described50.
Western Blotting. Protein extracts were prepared and blotted as described26,27.
The following antibodies were used: b-tubulin (mouse, 1:2000, Sigma), Cdk 2
(rabbit, 1:500, Santa Cruz Biotechnology), Cyclin D1 (mouse, 1:500, Santa
Cruz Biotechnology), ErbB2 (rabbit, 1:500, Santa Cruz Biotechnology), ErbB3
(rabbit, 1:500, Santa Cruz Biotechnology), GAPDH (mouse, 1:5000 Abcam),
Krox20 (rabbit, 1:2500, Covance), NICD (mouse, 1:1000, Chemicon), phos-

Signaling Technology), phospho-p38 (rabbit, 1:1000, Cell Signaling Technology), P0 (mouse, 1:2000, Astexx). HRP-conjugated secondary antibodies were
used and developed with ECL reagent (Amersham Biosciences). Experiments were repeated three times with fresh samples and representative pictures
are shown. For in vitro experiments, fresh cultures were used each time. For
in vivo experiments, embryonic nerves were isolated from several embryos
from at least two litters and postnatal nerves from at least two animals
were used. Uncropped pictures of western blots are in Supplementary
Figure 9 online.
Semi-quantitative PCR. Protocols for RNA extraction from nerve samples and
cDNA synthesis have been described47 and the primers used are found in
Supplementary Table 7. Experiments were repeated three times with fresh
samples and representative pictures are shown. For each experiment, embryonic nerves or DRGs were isolated from several embryos. For isolation of
postnatal nerves, at least two animals were used.
Statistical analysis. All values are shown as mean ± s.e.m. from at least three
independent experiments and considered significant if P o 0.01. Significance
between groups was calculated using Student’s t-tests.
