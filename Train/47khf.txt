Brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) is a survival factor
for specific subsets of sensory neurons during development1.
However, the expression of BDNF increases in peripheral targets
and in sensory neurons themselves in postnatal life, suggesting
that BDNF has important functions in maturity2. Previous studies of animals deprived of other neurotrophins determined that
loss of one neurotrophic factor or its preferred high-affinity
receptor can lead to the loss of one or more functionally defined
types of sensory neurons1,3. Thus, mice lacking nerve growth factor or trkA receptors display a severe loss of nociceptors4,5, whereas animals lacking neurotrophin-3 (NT-3) or the trkC receptor
possess no proprioceptive neurons6,7. In addition, NT-3 is
required for postnatal survival of cutaneous mechanoreceptive
neurons8, including slowly adapting mechanoreceptors (SAM),
which innervate Merkel cells in the skin. Studies on the expression
of the high-affinity BDNF receptor trkB in the dorsal root ganglia
indicate that 20-40% of cutaneous neurons with intermediateto-large soma can respond to BDNF9; such cells generally have
a myelinated axon.
Here we have used electrophysiological recording10 to analyze the functional properties of sensory neurons responsive to
BDNF in BDNF-deficient mutant mice11. This approach allowed
us to determine which functional types of sensory neurons
require BDNF in vivo. We show that SAM neurons, which are
required for fine tactile discrimination, show severely impaired
mechanosensitivity when BDNF levels are reduced, and that this
defect can be rescued by exogenous BDNF.
Results
We concentrated on cutaneous sensory neurons with myelinated
axons, which constitute most of the DRG neurons with medium-to-large cell bodies12. Both homo- and heterozygous BDNF
knockout mice exhibited dramatic deficits in the mechanotransduction properties of one specific subset of cutaneous afferents
(Figs. 1 and 2), namely the SAMs, most of which innervate specialized Merkel cells in the touch-dome complexes of the skin8,13.

Brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) is a survival factor for certain sensory neurons during
development. Using electrophysiology in BDNF-deficient mice, we show here that slowly adapting
mechanoreceptors (SAM), but not other types of cutaneous afferents, require BDNF in postnatal life
for normal mechanotransduction. Neurons lacking BDNF did not die, but instead showed a
profound and specific reduction in their mechanical sensitivity, which was quantitatively the same in
BDNF -/- and BDNF +/- animals. Postnatal treatment of BDNF +/- mice with recombinant BDNF completely rescued the mechanosensitivity deficit. Therefore BDNF is important for regulating SAM
mechanosensitivity, independent of any survival-promoting function.
was increased eightfold from 1.4 mN in wild-type to 11.2 mN in
BDNF -/- mice (p<0.001, U-test). In adult mice, the median
mechanical threshold was increased tenfold, from 1.0 mN to 11.2
mN in mice heterozygous for the BDNF mutation (p<0.001, Utest). The stimulus–response function for the entire population
of SAMs to suprathreshold constant-force stimuli exhibited a
reduced slope in homozygotes (F1,152 = 12.6, p<0.001, ANOVA),
as well as in heterozygotes (F1,311 = 82.2, p<0.001, ANOVA). In
contrast, other measures of afferent function, such as peak firing frequency after suprathreshold stimulation or conduction
velocity, were unimpaired (conduction velocities: wild-type adult,
15.5 ± 0.5 m per s; wild-type juvenile, 10.6 ± 0.6 m per s; BDNF
+/-, 16.6 ± 1.0 m per s; BDNF -/-, 10.3 ± 1.0 m per s, p>0.5 ttest). Moreover, other afferents with the same conduction velocities but different adaptation properties were substantially
unchanged. Thus rapidly adapting mechanoreceptors and the
intermediate RA/SA (rapidly adapting/slowly adapting) afferents10, seen only in juvenile animals, were indistinguishable from
wild-type afferents (Fig. 3). This was also true for thin myelinated sensory afferents, the rapidly adapting D-hair afferents and
the A-fiber mechanonociceptors10.
The specific effect on SAMs in BDNF-deficient mice indicates
that changes in skin compliance are unlikely to explain the
changes in the sensitivity of SAMs. Such changes would be
expected to affect other types of sensory afferents equally. In normal mice, the sensitivity of SAMs increased significantly from
the third postnatal week until adulthood (F1,254 = 19.4, p<0.001,
ANOVA). This sensitivity increase was reduced severely in BDNFdeficient animals, suggesting that increasing levels of BDNF in
the growing animal may be important in the postnatal maturation of SAMs.
Normally, BDNF has been considered a survival factor for
sensory neurons during development1. However, the population
of large-diameter, myelinated cutaneous afferents that we have
examined in detail do not seem to require BDNF for survival.
Because the saphenous nerve is a purely cutaneous nerve, all its
myelinated axons are sensory neurons, and therefore their num-

ber and size directly reflect the health of the recorded population
of afferent fibers. In semi-thin histological sections of the nerve,
neither the absolute number of neurons or axons nor the distribution of axon diameters was significantly altered (p>0.2, t-test)
in BDNF-deficient mice (Fig. 3). Juvenile wild-type and BDNF
-/- nerves contained 433 ± 51 and 391 ± 38 myelinated axons,
respectively (mean ± SEM). Adult nerves contained slightly more
myelinated axons, but this was also not different between nerves
taken from wild-type, 510 ± 50, and BDNF +/- mice, 470 +/- 22
(mean ± SEM).
Consistent with these findings, the prevalence of receptor types
in both -/- and adult +/- BDNF-deficient mice was not significantly different from controls. This indicates that no subtype of
sensory neuron among those studied was selectively lost or
reduced in number (Table 1). In normal mice, four major types
of afferents are encountered among the myelinated cutaneousafferent population. These include the fastest-conducting SAM
and rapidly adapting mechanoreceptor afferents and the slowerconducting D-hair afferents and A-fiber mechanonociceptors. In
juvenile animals, an additional type of afferent called the RA/SA,
which is not fully differentiated, is observed between 14–20 days
postnatally10. All of these afferent types were found in normal
numbers after unbiased sampling of all mechanoreceptive neurons in BDNF -/- and adult BDNF +/- mice (Table 1). The normal survival of these cutaneous neurons in BDNF-deficient mice
contrasts with animals heterozygous for mutations of the NT-3
gene, which selectively lose both SAMs and D-hair afferents and
have a corresponding loss of axons from the nerve8.
In both the BDNF -/- and +/- animals, we saw specific impairments in the mechanosensitivity of SAMs. These afferents innervate Merkel cells in the
touch-dome complexes of the
skin. The morphology and innervation of Merkel cells can be
examined conveniently by double immunostaining for the cells
and their innervating axons.
Merkel cells were labeled with
antibodies against cytokeratin-18,
and the innervating axons and
terminals were labeled with antineurofilament antibodies8. Such
experiments showed that the
morphological integrity of the
sensory–Merkel cell complex was
indistinguishable from that in wild-type mice (Fig. 3). The Merkel
cells in hairy skin depend on innervation by SAMs for their survival postnatally8,14,15. Therefore, we quantified the number of
Merkel cells by labeling them with the vital dye quinacrine15. The
number and morphology of Merkel cells was normal in touch
domes of the back of 14-day-old -/- animals (17.7 ± 4.9 cells per
dome versus 16.6 ± 5.6 in wild-type animals, p>0.5, t-test). In
contrast, Merkel cells are completely absent in 14-day-old mice
lacking NT-38. We also confirmed in adult BDNF +/- mice that
quinacrine-labeled Merkel cells were normal in number and morphology (data not shown). Thus, neither loss of Merkel cells nor
morphological alterations in their innervating axons could explain
the marked loss in mechanical sensitivity of SAM afferents. Moreover, the ability of SAMs to support Merkel cells is not altered in
BDNF-deficient animals.
Because mechanotransduction in a subset of sensory neurons was severely impaired and because it is clear that BDNF
itself cannot be a mechanotransducer protein, we reasoned that
endogenous BDNF regulates the functional properties of the
mechanotransducer. To test this idea, we conducted a further
series of rescue experiments in which exogenous BDNF protein was given systemically to BDNF-deficient mice (1 mg per
kg subcutaneous twice daily) from birth until we recorded
afferents between the 16th and 17th postnatal days. If exogenous BDNF regulates the molecular participants of a mechanotransduction complex, it should rescue the functional
impairment in the SAMs. Electrophysiological experiments
were done blind with respect to the genotype, with a total of
115 additional afferent neurons recorded from a total of 12
mice. In these studies, we deliberately concentrated on the funcFig. 1. Response properties of SAM afferents in wild-type and BDNF -/- and +/- mice. (a) The stimulus response of SAM afferents was
severely impaired across all stimulus strengths in BDNF -/- animals compared to age-matched littermates. (b) The same proportional impairment was seen for SAMs recorded in adult BDNF +/- mice. The sensitivity of SAMs in wild-type animals increased from the third postnatal

tional characterization of SAMs, recording a total of 11 in
BDNF-treated +/- animals and 6 in untreated +/- mice.
The juvenile BDNF +/- animals displayed mechanotransduction deficits that were not significantly different from those
of -/- animals (F1,102 = 2.3, p>0.1, ANOVA). However, the SAM
afferents from BDNF-treated +/- animals showed a profound
increase in mechanosensitivity compared to their untreated +/-
littermates. The median von Frey threshold of afferents from
BDNF-treated +/- animals was 1.0 mN, compared to 5.0 mN for
untreated +/- controls. Quantitative stimulus–response functions confirmed that the sensitivity of SAMs in BDNF-treated
+/- mice was significantly higher than for untreated +/- mice
(F1,134 = 21.5, p<0.001, ANOVA; Fig. 4). There was no difference between the stimulus–response functions of BDNF-treated BDNF+/- animals and wild-type controls (F1,182 = 2.2, p>0.1,
ANOVA). In addition, the A-fiber mechanonociceptors recorded from BDNF-treated mice were more sensitive than those
recorded in untreated
wild-type or BDNF +/-
mice. The median threshold of A-fiber mechanonociceptors in juvenile
BDNF-treated +/- mice
and wild-type mice was 1
mN, compared to 5.6 mN
in untreated wild-type
mice (p<0.001, U-test).
Discussion
These results reveal several
new aspects of the role of
BDNF in vivo. First, cutaneous SAMs are specific
targets for BDNF. This
extends the growing body
of evidence that specific
neurotrophins act on specific subsets of cutaneous
sensory neurons1,2,8. Second, BDNF regulates the
receptive properties of SAM neurons rather than their survival.
We have demonstrated previously that NT-3 is required for the
survival of SAM neurons in postnatal life8. Thus, NT-3 and BDNF
act on the same neuron to control survival and mechanotransduction properties, respectively. Such a differential role of neurotrophin action on sensory neurons has not been previously
recognized. In mice lacking the low-affinity neurotrophin receptor p75, SAMs show neither selective death nor decreased mechanical sensitivity, indicating that the low-affinity neurotrophin
receptor is not involved in regulating SAM survival or function16.
Therefore, the present findings may explain why many adult cutaneous sensory neurons express both trkB and the NT-3 receptor
trkC9. Our results further suggest that at least some of the trk B/trk
C-expressing cells are SAMs. Evidence from studies of the whisker
pad show that Merkel cells are lost in mice lacking NT-3 or trkC,
but not in animals lacking BDNF or trkB17. Moreover, mice with
function-blocking mutations of the trkB receptor display

mechanosensitivity deficits but no SAM neuron loss (C.L. Stucky,
G.R. Lewin and R. Klein, unpublished observations). This strongly supports the idea that NT-3 and BDNF work via the trkC and
trkB receptor in the same cell to mediate survival and receptive
properties, respectively. Our data are consistent with another suggestion that trk A and trk B may be expressed together in single
sensory neurons18, because A-fiber-mechanonociceptor afferents
respond both to nerve growth factor1 and to exogenous BDNF.
Interestingly, these nociceptive neurons are sensitized to mechanical stimuli by BDNF-treatment but do not require the factor for
their normal mechanosensitivity.
Coexistence of trkB and trkC in central neurons is a common
phenomenon, which has most often been discussed in terms of
a dual neurotrophic requirement or multifactorial support for a
given neuron population19,20. Yet, our data show that discrete
aspects of neuronal function can be regulated simultaneously by
the availability of two different neurotrophins. No altered
mechanosensitivity of SAMs has been observed in NT-4 knockout mice (C.L. Stucky et al., Soc. Neurosci. Abstr. 22, 992, 1996),
which is somewhat surprising considering that NT-4 is also a ligand for the trkB receptor. One explanation could be that only
BDNF, and not other ligands of the trkB receptor, can regulate
certain properties of sensory neurons. Alternatively, BDNF and
NT-4 could be differentially distributed in the targets of the neurons either temporally or spatially. Indeed, a large subpopulation
of neurons in the dorsal root ganglion contain BDNF21,22, but
these are probably not SAMs because SAMs and these BDNFexpressing neurons differ in soma size and their central projections23. We found here that systemic BDNF can rescue the
mechanosensitivity deficit when administered during the first
two weeks of life. This suggests that the target source of BDNF
may be in the periphery. One potential candidate is the Merkel
cells innervated by SAMs.
The SAM neurons in BDNF-deficient mice displayed normal
adaptation properties but markedly decreased sensitivity to
suprathreshold stimuli. Their sensitivity was even reduced compared to nociceptive neurons10. The same proportional deficits
in mechanotransduction occurred in SAMs regardless of whether
one or both BDNF alleles were inactivated. This could mean that
a threshold level of BDNF is required to regulate mechanical sensitivity, and once this level is reached, mature mechanosensitivity develops. Such all-or-none regulation also has been observed
for long term potentiation in the hippocampus of BDNF-mutant
mice11. In normal but not BDNF-deficient mice, BDNF acts to
promote the maturation of SAM function as receptor sensitivity increases during postnatal development (Fig. 1). However, the
effect is specific for the mechanical sensitivity of these neurons
as other physiological properties that increase during postnatal
maturation, such as axonal conduction velocity, are independent
of BDNF availability.
The present experiments indicate both histologically and electrophysiologically that no significant loss of myelinated afferents
occurs in BDNF-deficient mice. Initially, this finding seems to
contradict the first reports on BDNF-deficient mice, which
showed with uncorrected cell-counting methods that up to 30%
of sensory neurons of the DRG require BDNF for survival24,25.
However, our analysis shows that the majority of these missing
neurons do not belong to the myelinated population of sensory
neurons that innervate skin, which comprise at most 25% of the
total sensory neurons in a dorsal root ganglion. In BDNF-deficient mice, SAM afferents were physiologically healthy, as indicated by axon size, conduction velocity and the presence of
normal Merkel cells. Therefore, we believe this mechanosensitivity deficit seen in the SAMs of BDNF-deficient mice probably
reflects a critical regulation of genes that code for proteins
required for mechanotransduction.
At present, the gene products conferring mechanosensitivity
in mammals are unknown. In the nematode worm C.elegans, at
least 17 different gene products have been estimated to collaborate
in conferring normal touch-receptor sensitivity26. Therefore, a
deficit in mechanotransduction may result from a downregulation of one or more essential genes. Cloning of mutated genes in
touch-insensitive mutants of C.elegans suggests that such mechanotransduction genes could be conserved across species 27. We suggest that such candidate mammalian genes might be subject to
strong regulation by neurotrophic factors.
Methods
KNOCKOUT MICE. Mice with a null mutation of the BDNF gene were made
using conventional gene targeting techniques as described11. In our hands,
these mice, which have a BDNF null mutation on a mixed genetic background, can survive until the end of the third postnatal week. This is significantly longer than BDNF null mice on other genetic backgrounds24,25,
enabling us to record electrophysiologically from BDNF -/- mice, which
only becomes possible after postnatal day 14.
ELECTROPHYSIOLOGY. An in vitro skin/nerve preparation was used to record
from functionally single primary afferents in micro-dissected teased filaments of the saphenous nerve, as described10. Juvenile (14–26 days of
age) wild-type or BDNF -/- animals or adult (>6 weeks of age) wild-type
or BDNF +/- mice were used. Animals were killed by CO2-inhalation and
after shaving, skin of the hindlimb was removed with the saphenous nerve
attached. The nerve was dissected free to the lumbosacral plexus to ensure
a sufficient length of nerve for recording. After dissection, the preparation
was placed “inside-up” in an organ bath to facilitate oxygenation through
the corium side of the skin, and the preparation was superfused
(15 ml/min) with an oxygen-saturated modified synthetic interstitial fluid
solution containing (in mM) 123 NaCl, 3.5 KCl, 0.7 MgSO4, 1.7
NaH2PO4, 2.0 CaCl2, 9.5 sodium gluconate, 5.5 glucose, 7.5 sucrose and
10 HEPES at a pH of 7.4 ± 0.05 and a temperature of 32 ± 0.5º C. Once
the receptive field of a single unit had been identified with a mechanical
search stimulus, its receptive properties were systematically examined
with calibrated von Frey hairs and a feedback-controlled constant-force
stimulator, as described10. By recording from a sample of neurons representing about 20% of the axons present in one nerve, we can obtain
accurate estimates of the proportion of different receptor types in wildFig. 4. Response properties of SAM afferents in BDNF +/- mice
with (L ) and without (l ) treatment with exogenous recombinant
BDNF. For comparison, mean data of Fig. 1 is replotted for
untreated wild-type (P ) and BDNF -/- (p ) SAMs. SAMs taken from
BDNF-treated BDNF heterozygote animals respond normally to
mechanical force stimuli. Data from Fig. 1 (P14-21) is comparable to
these data from P16-17 because differentiation and sensory innervation of Merkel cells do not change significantly in this age range8. Mean discharge frequency (impulses/s)

type and transgenic mice. We have sampled afferent neurons using an
initial mechanical search stimulus that consisted of probing the skin with
a blunt glass rod. We have found in previous studies that this sampling
method gives remarkably consistent proportions of receptor types in
wild-type mice8,10,16. We probably have not missed a large population
of mechanically insensitive afferents, as the initial stimuli used is capable of exciting all types of mechanoreceptive afferents, including highthreshold nociceptors10. In the rescue experiments (see Results), no
systematic sampling of all types of afferent was undertaken, as we were
specifically interested in the mechanosensitivity of SAM neurons. Animals used in these rescue experiments were given twice-daily injections
of recombinant human BDNF (1mg/kg s.c. provided by Regeneron Inc.)
from the day of birth until the day of the experiment.
HISTOLOGY. After the animals were killed, a piece of the saphenous nerve
was dissected at the upper thigh from adult or 14-day-old wild-type, heterozygous, and homozygous mice, fixed in 2.5% glutaraldehyde and
embedded in epon. Semi-thin sections were transversely cut with glass
knives and stained with toluidine blue. All myelinated axon profiles were
counted and measured under high magnification (x1000, immersion oil
optics) to obtain the number and diameter of all axons8.
For immunohistochemistry, pieces of back skin of four juvenile or
adult heterozygous mice were cut tangentially on a cryostat and
immunostained as described8. Primary antibodies were directed against
cytokeratin 18 (RGE53, Bio-Science, Emmenbrücke, Switzerland; diluted 1:10) against neurofilament H (NA 1121, Boehringer, Mannheim,
Germany; diluted 1:500). Secondary antibodies were appropriate TRITCor FITC-conjugated goat (Dianova, Hamburg, Germany) antibodies. All
antibodies were diluted in 0.1 M PBS containing 1% NGS and 0.2% Triton-X 100. Sections were viewed under a Leitz confocal laser-scanning
microscope.
