Reelin is an essential glycoprotein for the establishment of the
highly organized six-layered structure of neurons of the mammalian neocortex. Although the role of Reelin in the control of
neuronal migration has been extensively studied at the molecular
level, the mechanisms underlying Reelin-dependent neuronal layer
organization are not yet fully understood. In this study, we directly
showed that Reelin promotes adhesion among dissociated neocortical neurons in culture. The Reelin-mediated neuronal aggregation occurs in an N-cadherin–dependent manner, both in vivo and
in vitro. Unexpectedly, however, in a rotation culture of dissociated
neocortical cells that gradually reaggregated over time, we found
that it was the neural progenitor cells [radial glial cells (RGCs)],
rather than the neurons, that tended to form clusters in the presence of Reelin. Mathematical modeling suggested that this clustering of RGCs could be recapitulated if the Reelin-dependent
promotion of neuronal adhesion were to occur only transiently.
Thus, we directly measured the adhesive force between neurons and N-cadherin by atomic force microscopy, and found
that Reelin indeed enhanced the adhesiveness of neurons to
N-cadherin; this enhanced adhesiveness began to be observed
at 30 min after Reelin stimulation, but declined by 3 h. These
results suggest that Reelin transiently (and not persistently)
promotes N-cadherin–mediated neuronal aggregation. When
N-cadherin and stabilized β-catenin were overexpressed in the
migrating neurons, the transfected neurons were abnormally
distributed in the superficial region of the neocortex, suggesting
that appropriate regulation of N-cadherin–mediated adhesion is important for correct positioning of the neurons during neocortical
development.
Reelin | N-cadherin | aggregation | corticogenesis | neuronal migration
The mammalian neocortex is highly organized into six neuronal layers. This laminar structure is responsible for the
complex motor, sensory, and cognitive functions of the mammalian brain (1). Neuronal migration plays an important role in
the establishment of this layered structure. Cortical neurons are
generated within the ventricular zone (VZ) or subventricular
zone (SVZ), and migrate along radial fibers toward the pial
surface. Newly born excitatory neurons migrate radially into the
cortical plate (CP) past the neurons born earlier, resulting in a
birth date-dependent “inside-out” alignment of the neurons in
the CP (2–4).
Reelin is a glycoprotein that is secreted by the Cajal–Retzius
cells in the marginal zone (MZ) of the cortex during neocortical
development (5–7). This glycoprotein is essential for establishment of the aforementioned birth date-dependent layered
structure of the neocortex, because the CP neurons show an
almost inverted alignment in the neocortex of the Reelindeficient, reeler mice. In addition, neurons born at the same time
tend to be distributed broadly and not to form clear layers in the
reeler cortex (8, 9). Although extensive studies, including at the
molecular level, have been conducted to determine the role of
Reelin in neuronal migration in the neocortex (10–14), the
cellular and molecular functions of Reelin in neuronal layer
formation in the neocortex are not yet fully understood.
In recently carried out studies, we revealed that ectopic expression of Reelin by in utero electroporation caused neuronal
aggregation in the developing mouse neocortex (15–17). In addition, we found that immature neurons were densely packed in the
outermost region of the developing cortex (i.e., beneath the MZ),
which is termed the primitive cortical zone (PCZ) (18), supporting
the notion that Reelin may somehow be involved in the aggregation of migrating neurons beneath the MZ in vivo. However, it
is not yet clear whether Reelin directly promotes adhesion among
neurons or, instead, causes them to form aggregates as a result of
being repelled by the surrounding cellular environment. Thus, in
this study, we investigated the role of Reelin in neuronal aggregation/adhesion during neocortical development.
Results
To determine whether Reelin can cause aggregation of cortical
cells in vitro, we dissociated cortical cells from embryonic day (E)
14.5 reeler mice and cultured them on polyethylenimine-coated
dishes, which allowed the cells to move around at least to some
extent. The cultured cells were then treated with mock or Reelincontaining medium for 24 h. The experiment revealed that more
cell aggregates were formed after Reelin stimulation than after
mock treatment (Fig. 1 A, A′, B, B′, and D and Fig. S1). Formation
Significance
It has long been thought that Reelin is a stop signal for migrating neocortical neurons, because the neurons stop just
beneath Reelin-rich regions. Our recent studies revealed that
ectopically expressed Reelin can also cause neuronal aggregation with clear demarcation in vivo, suggesting that Reelin is
not simply a stop signal. However, it remains unclear whether
Reelin directly promotes adhesion among neurons or only
causes them to be repelled by the surrounding cellular environment, facilitating their aggregation. We show here that
Reelin directly promotes N-cadherin–dependent neuronal adhesion, causing neuronal aggregation. This Reelin-dependent
neuronal adhesion occurs only transiently, and is not sustained.
This dynamic change of N-cadherin–mediated cellular adhesiveness is important for establishment of the appropriate
layering of neocortical neurons.

of cell aggregates was observed at a level similar to the level observed in the mock control when 2A-Reelin was used; 2A-Reelin
is the product of a point mutation of Reelin that contains two
mutant lysine residues, which prevents binding of Reelin to its
receptors (19) (Fig. 1 C, C′, and D and Fig. S1). These results
suggest that Reelin can directly induce cortical cell aggregation via
its receptors.
To examine further whether this cell aggregation is mediated
by the well-established Reelin signaling pathway, we performed
similar experiments using neurons obtained from the cortex of
yotari mutant mice, which are deficient in Disabled 1 (Dab1), an
intracellular adaptor protein that binds to the Reelin receptors
and is essential for transduction of the Reelin signal (20–25).
This experiment revealed that Reelin was unable to cause clear
aggregation of the cells derived from the yotari homozygous mice
(Fig. 1J), indicating that the Reelin-induced cortical cell aggregation is mediated by the well-known Reelin pathway involving
Dab1. Immunohistochemical analyses showed that the Reelininduced cell aggregates were mainly composed of neurons that
were positive for microtubule-associated protein 2 (MAP2) (Fig.
1 F–F′′ and H–H′′) and neuronal nuclei (NeuN) (Fig. S2 A and
B), which is consistent with our previous finding that ectopically
overexpressed Reelin caused aggregation of migrating neurons
in vivo (15). It is worthy of note, however, that some nestinpositive and paired box protein 6 (Pax6)-positive neural progenitor cells [radial glial cells (RGCs)] were also incorporated
into these aggregates. Because the RGCs tended to be located
near the surface of the aggregates, the RGCs may participate in
the cell aggregation by adhering to the neurons, or may be excluded from the aggregated neurons. Reelin treatment did not
significantly affect the number of NeuN-positive neurons or
Pax6-positive RGCs in this culture (24 h) (Fig. S2 C–E).
Reelin is well known to control some cell adhesion molecules,
such as N-cadherin (11, 14, 26) and integrin α5β1 (12). In regard
to the adhesion molecule mediating the Reelin-dependent neuronal aggregation, we thought that N-cadherin might be a good
candidate because N-cadherin is present in abundance in the
cortical MZ (27). Therefore, we examined whether N-cadherin
could also be detected when the migrating neurons aggregated
in vivo in response to ectopically overexpressed Reelin in the
developing neocortex (15). As expected, immunohistochemical
examination revealed strong detection of N-cadherin in the
central cell body-sparse, dendrite-rich, MZ-like region of the
ectopic aggregates in vivo (12) (Fig. 2A). When expression vectors for the dominant-negative (DN) form of N-cadherin and
green fluorescent protein (GFP) were cotransfected with the
Reelin expression vector, the central MZ-like regions of the
in vivo aggregates were invaded by migrating neurons and
the margin of the aggregates became blurred, losing their spheroidal shape (Fig. 2D). The GFP-positive cells, which were
aligned near the surface of the aggregates in a radial manner,
with their processes directed toward the central MZ-like region
when the control vector or N-cadherin expression vector was
transfected (Fig. 2 B, C, and E), appeared to be randomly oriented within the aggregates when the DN form of N-cadherin
was transfected (Fig. 2D). N-cadherin knockdown (KD) with
Reelin overexpression also disrupted the centers of the neuronal
aggregates and the radial orientation of the GFP-positive cells
(Fig. 2F). These N-cadherin/KD phenotypes were rescued by
cotransfection of the cells with a KD-resistant type of N-cadherin
(Fig. 2G). These results imply that Reelin promotes neuronal
aggregation via N-cadherin in vivo. In vitro also, inhibition of
Reelin-dependent neuronal aggregation was observed following
KD of N-cadherin in the cultured cortical cells (Fig. 2 H–N),
further confirming the involvement of N-cadherin in the Reelininduced neuronal aggregation.
Genotype-dependent differences in the cortical cell aggregation pattern between reeler and wild-type mice were previously
analyzed using a rotation culture of dissociated cortical cells (6,
28). In this study, we took advantage of this rotation culture system, using the original system with some modifications, to investigate whether exogenous Reelin could modulate the aggregation
pattern of reeler cortical cells. To this end, we first transfected an
expression plasmid for Reelin (or control plasmid) with a GFP
expression construct into the E12.0 reeler cortical cells by electroporation. The transfected cortices were then dissociated into
single cells and cultured in a rotating tube for 5 d. As reported
previously, the cortical cells showed reaggregation into spheres
during the culture; this finding was confirmed by immunohistochemical analyses using markers for neurons (MAP2) and RGCs
(nestin) (Fig. 3 A and B and Fig. S3 A and B). Interestingly,
overexpression of Reelin in a fraction of the cultured cells caused
clustering of the RGCs in the inner part of the reaggregated reeler
cells (Fig. 3B, arrowhead, and Fig. S3B, dotted line). Although we
initially assumed, based on the above-mentioned results (Figs. 1
and 2), that it is the neurons, rather than the RGCs, that form
clusters in response to Reelin, neurons were unexpectedly distributed more diffusely than the RGCs and tended to be excluded
from the nestin-positive RGC clusters.
To determine the reason for this unexpected clustering of the
RGCs in the inner part of the reaggregated cellular spheres, we
used mathematical modeling of the reaggregation culture based
on a recently described method (29), in an attempt to identify the
factor(s) that could be important for recapitulating the cell reaggregation patterns in the presence or absence of Reelin.

In this mathematical model, we hypothesized that Reelin
would enhance the cell–cell adhesion among neurons (Fig. 3C). In
the absence of Reelin (r = 0, where r denotes the density of
Reelin-secreting cells or the local concentration of Reelin itself),
cell adhesion among neurons and RGCs was set to be identical (10
for any combination of cell types; Fig. 3C). In the presence of
Reelin (r > 0), the cell adhesion among neurons was set to be
increased (10 + 20r; Fig. 3C). The simulation assumed that the
RGCs and neurons would be homogeneously distributed in the
absence of Reelin (Fig. 3E and Movie S1). On the other hand, in
the Reelin-present condition (r > 0), RGC clusters were seen in
the aggregates, even though the RGC–RGC interaction was not
set to be promoted (Fig. 3F and Movie S2). Nevertheless, the
RGC clusters formed near the periphery of the aggregates tended
to be localized along the edges of the aggregates (Fig. S3D), which
appeared to be inconsistent with the aforementioned finding observed in living cells (Fig. 3B and Fig. S3B), wherein the RGC
clusters were located in the inner parts of the reaggregated cells
and the periphery was mainly occupied by neurons.
In our previous study, we showed that when the neurons
completed radial migration, they were transiently localized in the
most superficial region of the CP, or the PCZ, where they accumulated at a high cell density (18). After the neurons were
released from the PCZ and settled in the CP, the neuronal cell
density became lower than in the PCZ. Thus, we hypothesized
that Reelin might cause a transient, rather than persistent,
increase of cell–cell adhesion among neurons (Fig. 3D; transition
from immature neurons with strong adhesiveness to mature
neurons with weak adhesiveness was hypothesized). Simulation
of this transition showed that in the Reelin-present and transition-present conditions, RGC clusters were formed only in the
inner parts of the aggregates [Fig. 3G, Fig. S3E (a space between
an RGC cluster and the edge of the aggregate is indicated by
white asterisks), and Movie S3], resembling the pattern observed
in the reaggregated living cells described above (Fig. 3B and Fig.
S3B). Thus, our mathematical model predicted that the Reelininduced increase in cell–cell adhesion among neurons would
need to be only transient for the RGC clusters to form in the
inner part of the reaggregated reeler cell spheres.
To investigate whether Reelin indeed promotes N-cadherin–
mediated neuronal adhesion only transiently, we next applied
atomic force microscopy (AFM)-based single-molecule force
spectroscopy to quantify the adhesive interaction between the
N-cadherin–coated cantilever tip and a cultured neuron. We
stimulated primary cortical neurons with Reelin-containing medium or control medium (Mock) for 30 min or 3 h. Then, we
measured the “work for detachment,” which means the work
required for detaching the N-cadherin–coated cantilever from
the single neuron, and the “unbinding force,” which reflects the
maximal adhesive force between the N-cadherin–coated cantilever and a single neuron, from the obtained force-distance
curves (Fig. S4A). This experiment revealed that Reelin

stimulation indeed caused a significant increase in both of these
parameters within 30 min of its addition, indicating that the
adhesive force between N-cadherin and neurons was strengthened by Reelin stimulation (Fig. 3 H and I and Fig. S4 B and C).
As predicted from the mathematical modeling, these parameters
decreased again to their initial levels by 3 h after the addition of
Reelin (Fig. 3 H and I and Fig. S4 D and E). These results
support our hypothesis that Reelin only transiently promotes
N-cadherin–mediated neuronal adhesion.
To understand the biological role of the decrease in the
adhesive forces between N-cadherin and neurons, we next
examined the effect of persistent enhancement of N-cadherin–
dependent adhesion. β-Catenin plays an important role in generating the cadherin-dependent adhesive force (30), and it is
known to be destabilized by phosphorylation of the serine/
threonine residues at positions 29, 33, 37, 41, and 45 (31, 32).
Deletion of a segment that included these sites (amino acids 29–
48 of β-catenin) results in the stabilization of β-catenin proteins
(33). We thus transfected migrating neurons in E14.5 mice with
expression vectors for N-cadherin and β-catenin (Δ29–48). This
experiment revealed that neurons coexpressing N-cadherin and
β-catenin (Δ29–48) exhibited abnormal positioning at postnatal
day (P) 7.5 (Fig. 4 A–E). More neurons remained immediately
beneath layer I compared with the control. It is noteworthy that
overexpression of the expression vectors for N-cadherin and/or
β-catenin (Δ29–48) at the same concentration (2.5 mg/mL) did
not significantly affect neuronal migration when observed at P0.5
(Fig. S5 A–E), whereas overexpression of N-cadherin at a higher
concentration (5.0 mg/mL) of the expression plasmid affected
neuronal migration (Fig. S5 F–J), as reported previously (34).
These results suggest that appropriate regulation, but not persistent increase, of the adhesive forces mediated by N-cadherin
is necessary for the cortical neurons to settle in their proper
positions eventually.
Discussion
Our recent investigation demonstrated that ectopically overexpressed Reelin in the developing neocortex caused aggregation
of the migrating neurons in the CP in vivo (15). However, it
remained unclear as to whether Reelin directly strengthened
adhesion among neurons or indirectly caused aggregation of the
neurons by, for example, causing the local cellular environment
to repel the migrating neurons. In this study, we found evidence
to suggest that Reelin directly causes neuronal cell aggregation
(Fig. 1) through N-cadherin (Fig. 2).
Previous studies have shown that Reelin regulates the plasma
membrane localization of N-cadherin through small GTPase Rap1
and serine/threonine kinase Akt in the migrating multipolar neurons
(11), and that it regulates cadherin functions through Dab1 and
Rap1 to control radial glia-independent somal translocation and
lamination during neocortical development (14). Reelin signaling to
Rap1 promotes N-cadherin functions via nectin3 and afadin toward
mediating cell–cell interactions between the migrating neurons and
Cajal–Retzius cells (26). However, these studies did not address the
time-dependent dynamic changes of cell adhesion mediated by
N-cadherin. Herein, we demonstrate that Reelin transiently, but not
persistently, increases cell–cell adhesion via N-cadherin (Fig. 3).
These transient, but not persistent, changes in N-cadherin–mediated
adhesiveness of the neurons would appear to be important for
transient formation of the cell-dense PCZ beneath the MZ and also
for enabling the neurons born later to pass by this zone appropriately to settle in their correct positions in the CP (Fig. 4).
The adhesive force among cells imparted by N-cadherin is
known to be controlled by several mechanisms. The cytoplasmic
domain of N-cadherin is known to play an important role in
generating the adhesive force through interaction with β-catenin
and p120 catenin (30). β-Catenin has a key role in the formation
of adherens junctions through its interactions with cadherin and
α-catenin (35). β-Catenin contains several serine and threonine

residues in the consensus positions for phosphorylation by glycogen synthase kinase 3β (GSK3β). This phosphorylation site is
known to be a prerequisite for ubiquitination of β-catenin and
regulation of β-catenin stability (31, 32). Because Reelin-Dab1
signaling triggers the phosphorylation of Akt (protein kinase B)
and inactivation of GSK3β in cultured cortical neurons (36, 37),
β-catenin is one of the strong candidates with respect to molecules mediating the Reelin-dependent control of N-cadherin–
mediated cell adhesion.
Similarly, p120 catenin also controls the cadherin-mediated
adhesion among cells by stabilizing cadherin at the plasma
membrane; in its absence, the cadherins are internalized through
endocytosis (38, 39). The p120 catenin–cadherin binding is strengthened by the interaction of p120 catenin with nectin-associated afadin
in a Rap1-dependent manner (40). Reelin recruits p120 catenin
and N-cadherin to the nectin and afadin complexes, enhancing the
N-cadherin–mediated cell adhesion (26). Thus, p120 catenin is
also a candidate molecule connecting the Reelin–Dab1 pathway
and N-cadherin. Future studies are required to elucidate the detailed mechanism underlying the time-dependent changes of
N-cadherin–mediated cell adhesion.
When we inhibited the N-cadherin functions in the Reelininduced cell aggregates in vivo, the cell body-sparse (MZ-like)
center of the neuronal aggregates and the radial orientation of the
GFP-positive cells were disrupted, but blurred cell aggregates
were still formed. This result could have occurred because we
transfected the DN form of N-cadherin (Fig. 2D) or N-cadherin
KD vector (Fig. 2F), which could have led to only incomplete
inhibition of the functions of N-cadherin, and the remaining exogenous N-cadherin might have mediated the residual weak adhesion. Another possibility is that residual adhesion, especially
adhesion among the cell bodies, mediated by adhesion molecules
other than N-cadherin contributed to the formation of the blurred
aggregates without the central MZ-like regions. In the mathematical model that we used, we rather simplified the conditions
for simulating the essential features of the cell aggregates. For
example, in this model, neurons and RGCs were assumed to be
distributed evenly within the aggregates in the absence of Reelin
(Fig. 3E), which might be somewhat different from the actual
pattern produced by the living cells (Fig. 3A). However, the degree
of cell sorting between living neurons and RGCs was obviously
increased in the presence of Reelin (Fig. 3B), which was successfully recapitulated with this model (Fig. 3 F and G and Fig. S3
D and E). The living neurons and RGCs might, to some extent,
interact in a homophilic manner even in the absence of Reelin. In
that case, it may be considered that the homophilic adhesion
among neurons is transiently enhanced by Reelin stimulation.
In this study, we provide evidence indicating that Reelin causes
a transient, but not persistent, increase in cell–cell adhesion
among neurons through N-cadherin. In vivo, when migrating
neurons reach the outermost zone, the PCZ, of the developing CP
and receive the Reelin signal, the immature neurons show strong
cell adhesiveness and become packed into the PCZ at a high cell
density. This “packing” may be beneficial for appropriate sorting
of the neurons in a birth date-dependent manner (41), although
further investigation is required to confirm this contention. Because the increase in the cell adhesiveness is presumably only
transient, it is thought that the cell–cell adhesion among these
neurons in the PCZ becomes weak subsequently, resulting in the
release of these neurons from the PCZ to a deeper position in the
CP (Fig. S6). Considering what the effect of a persistent increase
in the adhesiveness of the migrating neurons might be on their
final disposition (Fig. 4), this transient increase, followed by a
subsequent decrease in the cell adhesiveness, appears to be necessary for establishment of the highly organized layered structure
of the neurons in the mammalian neocortex. In the future, it will
be important to clarify the molecular mechanisms of the dynamic
changes of the cellular adhesiveness induced by Reelin and to
investigate the effect of inhibition of the “decrease mechanism” on
neuronal positioning in vivo.
Fig. 4. Decrease of the adhesive forces is necessary for appropriate neuronal positioning in vivo. Cerebral cortices at P7.5 electroporated with control (A),
N-cadherin (B; 2.5 mg/mL), β-catenin (β-cat; Δ29–48) expression plasmids (C; 2.5 mg/mL), or N-cadherin/β-catenin (Δ29–48) expression plasmids (D; 2.5 mg/mL +
2.5 mg/mL) at E14.5. A mock vector (an empty pCAGGS vector) was cotransfected to make the total DNA concentration constant. Details of the plasmid DNA
concentrations are described in Materials and Methods (Table S1). (A′–D′) GFP expression plasmid was also cotransfected to allow visualization of the
transfected cells. Nuclei were labeled with DAPI. (Scale bar, 100 μm.) (E) Bin analysis. The distance between the layer I/layer II boundary (arrowhead) and the
ventricular surface was divided into 10 bins. Results are expressed as mean ± SEM. Control, n = 7 brains; N-cadherin, n = 6 brains; β-catenin (Δ29–48), n = 5
brains; N-cadherin/β-catenin (Δ29–48), n = 7 brains. Means that are significantly different from each other in each bin are represented by different small
letters (P < 0.05).

Materials and Methods
Animals and Animal Treatment. Pregnant ICR mice were purchased from Japan
SLC. The colony of reeler mice (B6CFe a/a-Relnrl/J) obtained from The Jackson
Laboratory was maintained by allowing heterozygous or homozygous females to mate with homozygous males. The day of vaginal plug detection
was considered as E0. For example, “E14” was used to denote experiments
performed on the morning of E14 and “E14.5” was used for experiments
performed in the afternoon of E14. All animal experiments were performed
using protocols approved by the Keio University Institutional Animal Care
and Use Committee.
Details of construction of plasmids, in utero electroporation, dissociated
cell culture, rotation culture, preparation of frozen sections, immunohistochemistry and immunocytochemistry, high-content analysis, counting of
the primary culture cells, AFM, cell culture and transfection to prepare
Reelin medium, and mathematical models are provided in SI Materials
and Methods.
Statistical Analyses. All numerical data are expressed as mean ± SEM.
For comparing two groups, Student’s t test was used when neither normality nor homogeneity of variances of the dataset was rejected by the
Shapiro–Wilk normality test and Levene’s test, respectively. In cases where
normality was proven but homogeneity was rejected, Welch’s t test was
used. In cases where normality of the dataset alone was rejected, the Mann–
Whitney U test was conducted as a nonparametric test.
For comparing multiple groups, the normality of the data was tested by
the Shapiro–Wilk test, and the variance homogeneity among all groups was
tested by Levene’s test. When neither normality nor homogeneity of variance of the dataset to be analyzed was rejected by the above tests, ANOVA,
followed by the Tukey–Kramer test, was used. In cases where either normality or variance homogeneity was rejected, the Kruskal–Wallis test was
used, followed by the Games–Howell test. For all of the statistical tests
mentioned above, the α-value was set at 0.05.
